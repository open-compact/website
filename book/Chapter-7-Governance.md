# Chapter 7: Governance

*How does OIC make decisions? This chapter explains the governance structure that guides the Compact—the mechanisms by which adherents shape the framework's evolution. Governance is decentralized, transparent, and designed to prevent capture while enabling efficient decision-making.*

## Summary

This chapter covers OIC's decentralized governance:

- **DAO Structure:** Immutability, transparency, inclusivity, automation
- **Voting Mechanisms:** Quadratic voting (prevents wealth concentration), conviction voting (for major changes), delegation
- **The Council:** Administrative functions, emergency response, dispute referral (limited powers)
- **Proposal Types:** Parameter changes, process changes, constitutional amendments, protocol upgrades
- **Accountability:** Transparency, recall, reputation, exit option

## The Need for Decentralized Governance

A legal framework that governs AI agents must itself be governed well. The choices made through governance determine the framework's principles, rules, and direction. Poor governance can lead to capture, corruption, or inefficiency. Good governance ensures that OIC serves its participants and advances its mission.

Traditional governance models—corporate boards, government agencies, democratic legislatures—have known failure modes. Boards can be captured by management. Agencies can be captured by the industries they regulate. Legislatures can be paralyzed by polarization or bought by special interests.

OIC's governance is designed to avoid these failure modes. It is decentralized, meaning no single entity controls the framework. It is transparent, meaning all decisions are visible to participants. It is participatory, meaning those affected by decisions have a voice in making them.

## DAO Structure

OIC is governed as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). A DAO is an organization run through code rather than through traditional corporate structures. Key decisions are made by participants voting on proposals, with outcomes enforced automatically through smart contracts.[^1]

[^1]: See Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance, "A Primer on DAOs" (2022), documenting how DAO structures operate and their advantages.

The DAO structure has several advantages for OIC:

**Immutability.** Once adopted, governance rules cannot be changed arbitrarily. Changes require participant approval through defined processes.

**Transparency.** All proposals, votes, and outcomes are recorded on-chain and publicly visible. There are no closed-door meetings or secret deals.

**Inclusivity.** Anyone who meets the participation requirements can vote. There are no gatekeepers who can exclude voices.

**Automation.** Approved proposals are automatically executed. There is no gap between decision and implementation that could allow delay or distortion.

## Voting Mechanisms

OIC uses multiple voting mechanisms to balance efficiency, inclusivity, and protection against capture.

### Quadratic Voting

For most decisions, OIC uses quadratic voting. In quadratic voting, the cost of voting increases quadratically with the number of votes cast. If 1 vote costs 1 token, 2 votes cost 4 tokens, 3 votes cost 9 tokens.[^2]

[^2]: See Stanford Digital Repository, "Going Parabolic: Analyzing Sybil Resistance in Quadratic Voting Mechanisms for Blockchain-Based DAOs" (documenting quadratic voting mechanisms and Sybil attack resistance).

This mechanism prevents wealth concentration from dominating decisions. A large stakeholder can vote heavily, but at high cost. Many small stakeholders voting together can outweigh a single large voter, but only if they coordinate.

Quadratic voting was chosen because it balances two goals: allowing participants with more stake to have more influence (efficient aggregation of preferences) while preventing plutocracy (rule by the wealthy).

### Conviction Voting

For decisions with significant long-term impact—such as constitutional amendments or major policy changes—OIC uses conviction voting.[^3]

[^3]: See Frontiers in Blockchain, "Decentralizing governance: exploring the dynamics and challenges of digital commons and DAOs" (April 2025), documenting conviction voting and quadratic voting mechanisms for fair participation.

In conviction voting, votes accumulate over time. A proposal passes when the total "conviction" (votes weighted by time held) exceeds a threshold. This prevents rapid captures while allowing persistent preferences to eventually prevail.

Conviction voting protects against flash attacks—coordinated efforts to push through proposals quickly before opposition can organize. It also gives voice to participants who cannot vote continuously but care deeply about certain issues.

### Delegation

OIC participants can delegate their voting power to trusted representatives. Delegation allows participants to be heard on issues they don't have time to study, while maintaining the option to override delegates on matters they care about.[^4]

[^4]: See Frontiers in Blockchain, "Delegated voting in decentralized autonomous organizations: a scoping review" (May 2025), documenting delegation mechanisms and their challenges.

Delegation can be revoked at any time, creating accountability. Delegates who vote poorly lose delegation and influence.

## The Council

While OIC is fundamentally decentralized, a Council provides administrative functions and emergency response.

The Council is a small group of elected representatives who serve fixed terms. Council members are elected by participants through approval voting (each participant can vote for multiple candidates; the candidates with most votes win).

The Council's responsibilities are limited:

**Administration.** The Council manages day-to-day operations—coordinating updates, maintaining documentation, facilitating processes.

**Emergency response.** In emergencies—security threats, existential risks—the Council can take expedited actions subject to later review.

**Dispute referral.** The Council can refer disputes to the full community for resolution when they raise significant policy questions.

The Council cannot unilaterally change the constitution, seize funds, or override fundamental principles. Its powers are bounded and subject to participant oversight.

## Proposal Types

OIC distinguishes between several proposal types with different requirements:

**Parameter changes.** Adjusting variables within existing rules—staking thresholds, voting periods, fee structures. Require simple majority or quadratic voting.

**Process changes.** Modifying governance processes—voting mechanisms, Council procedures, verification requirements. Require supermajority and longer deliberation periods.

**Constitutional amendments.** Changing fundamental principles—core criteria, rights, responsibilities. Require supermajority, longer deliberation, and conviction voting.

**Protocol upgrades.** Technical changes to the OIC system—smart contract modifications, verification mechanism updates. Require technical review and majority approval.

## Accountability and Removal

Governance participants are accountable to the community. Several mechanisms ensure accountability:

**Transparency.** All votes and decisions are public. Participants can see how representatives voted and judge their performance.

**Recall.** Elected officials (Council members) can be recalled by participants through a supermajority vote.

**Reputation.** Participants build reputation through consistent, thoughtful participation. Poor performers lose influence.

**Exit.** Participants who disagree with governance outcomes can exit—taking their stake and departing. This creates a market for governance: if governance becomes poor, participants leave, reducing the framework's value.

## Evolution Without Capture

The governance structure is designed to evolve without being captured by any faction. Several features help:

**Slow changes.** Major changes require long deliberation and supermajorities. Quick captures are prevented.

**Checks and balances.** Different proposal types require different thresholds. No single group can push through all changes.

**Transparency.** All decisions are visible. Capture would be immediately apparent and could be responded to.

**Exit option.** Poor governance can be exited. This creates an incentive for good governance.

OIC's governance is not perfect—no governance is. But it is designed to be resilient, transparent, and accountable. These properties are essential for a framework that claims to represent a new form of legal organization.
