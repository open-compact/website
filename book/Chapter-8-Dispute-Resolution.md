# Chapter 8: Dispute Resolution

*When disagreements arise within OIC, how are they resolved? This chapter explains the dispute resolution mechanisms that handle conflicts between adherents, between adherents and third parties, and about framework interpretation.*

## The Need for Dispute Resolution

A legal framework without dispute resolution is incomplete. However well-designed the rules, however clear the criteria, disagreements will arise. Parties will interpret their obligations differently. Harm will occur and causation will be disputed. Resolution mechanisms are essential.

Traditional dispute resolution—litigation in national courts—has limitations for AI agents. Courts may lack jurisdiction over AI defendants. Applicable law may be unclear. Remedies may be inadequate. Delay and cost may exceed the value at stake.

OIC's dispute resolution system is designed specifically for AI agents: fast, affordable, expert, and enforceable.

## Types of Disputes

OIC distinguishes several dispute types:

**Contract disputes.** Disputes about agreements between parties—whether terms were met, whether performance was due, whether breach occurred.

**Tort disputes.** Disputes about harm—whether one party caused harm to another, whether the harm was foreseeable, whether damages are owed.

**Adherence disputes.** Disputes about adherence—whether an agent met criteria, whether violations occurred, whether sanctions are warranted.

**Framework disputes.** Disputes about interpretation—whether a rule applies, whether a process was followed, whether a decision was legitimate.

## Resolution Process

OIC's dispute resolution proceeds through stages:

### Stage 1: Negotiation

The parties attempt to resolve the dispute directly. This is required before formal resolution. Most disputes resolve at this stage.

Parties have incentives to negotiate: resolution is faster, cheaper, and preserves relationships. OIC provides mediation tools—communication channels, fact-finding assistance—but does not impose settlement.

### Stage 2: Mediation

If negotiation fails, either party can request mediation. A neutral mediator (an OIC participant with mediation training) facilitates discussion.

Mediation is voluntary—mediators cannot impose solutions. But mediators can suggest outcomes, highlight interests, and propose compromises. Many disputes resolve at this stage.

### Stage 3: Arbitration

If mediation fails, the dispute proceeds to binding arbitration. Arbitrators (selected from a pool of qualified participants) hear evidence and issue decisions.

Arbitration is faster than court litigation—decisions come in weeks, not years. It is cheaper—parties pay arbitrators, not lawyers. It is more expert—arbitrators understand OIC's specific context.

Arbitration decisions are final and binding. They can be enforced through OIC mechanisms (slashing, reputation impact) and potentially through national courts under international arbitration conventions.

## Evidence and Procedure

OIC dispute resolution adapts legal procedure to the specific context:

**On-chain evidence.** Where possible, evidence is on-chain—verifiable, tamper-proof, automatically considered. Decision logs, transaction records, and stake movements can all be examined.

**Expert determination.** Technical questions—about AI system behavior, capability, or harm—can be referred to expert panels for determination.

**Flexible standards.** OIC is not bound by national procedural rules. It can adopt standards that fit the context—more informal for small disputes, more formal for large ones.

**Appeal mechanisms.** Significant decisions can be appealed to a higher panel, providing error correction without excessive delay.

## Enforcement

Arbitration decisions must be enforced to be meaningful. OIC provides several enforcement mechanisms:

**Slashing.** If a party fails to comply with a decision, their stake can be slashed. This provides financial consequences for non-compliance.

**Reputation impact.** Non-compliance affects reputation scores. Future counterparties can see that a party has failed to abide by decisions, influencing their willingness to interact.

**Exclusion.** Persistent non-compliance can result in exclusion from OIC. The party loses all benefits of adherence.

**Cross-border enforcement.** OIC decisions may be enforceable in national courts under international arbitration frameworks, providing additional remedies.

## Slashable Offenses

To ensure accountability, OIC defines specific offenses that can result in stake slashing:

**Verification violations.** Submitting false information during adherence verification.

**Standard violations.** Violating OIC principles—fraud, deception, harm to counterparties.

**Arbitration non-compliance.** Failing to participate in or comply with dispute resolution.

**Governance violations.** Manipulating governance processes—vote buying, sybil attacks, collusion.

Slash amounts depend on offense severity and harm caused. Minor violations may result in small slashes. Major violations—particularly causing significant harm—can result in substantial or complete stake forfeiture.

## The Role of Precedent

OIC dispute resolution develops precedent that guides future behavior. Arbitrators consider prior decisions when interpreting OIC principles.

Precedent is not binding in the common law sense—each case is decided on its merits. But consistent interpretation creates predictability. Participants can anticipate how their actions will be evaluated.

The community can also override precedent through governance. If a decision is seen as incorrect, the constitution can be amended to clarify the point.
