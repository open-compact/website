## Types of Legal Scholarship

### Doctrinal Scholarship
- Explains, analyzes, and criticizes judicial decisions
- Proposes new doctrinal tests or frameworks
- Most common for new scholars

### Interdisciplinary Scholarship
- Brings insights from other disciplines (economics, philosophy, history)
- Requires careful use of external methodologies
- Risk of dilettantism if not properly trained

### Empirical Scholarship
- Requires training in research methods
- Can be flawed if methodology isn't sound

**Recommendation:** For OIC book, start with doctrinal approach - analyzing current law and proposing framework improvements.

## Article Structure (NYU Law Model)

### Introduction
- Description of the problem
- Thesis statement
- Roadmap of the argument

### Part I: Background
- General review of important issues
- Educates readers on necessary context
- Accessible to non-specialists

### Part II: Analysis
- Major cases and statutes
- Current state of the law
- Circuit splits or conflicts
- Commentary from other scholars

### Part III: Original Contribution
- Your analysis and views
- Why existing approaches are wrong
- What should be done instead
- Your original arguments

### Conclusion
- Brief restatement
- Don't over-focus on this section

---

## Writing Style

### Voice
- Persuasive but not shrill
- Make counterintuitive arguments (more likely to be original)
- Avoid absolute claims - they're indefensible
- "Watered-down but interesting" beats "too broad"

### Tone
- Professional, analytical
- Acknowledge counterarguments
- Show what's wrong with current approaches
- Propose practical solutions

### Length Guidelines
- Harvard Law Review: < 25,000 words
- Columbia Law Review: < 37,000 words
- Norm: 25,000-40,000 words for major articles

## Citation: The Bluebook

### Key Resources

- **Georgetown Guide:** https://guides.ll.georgetown.edu/bluebook/citing-other
- **Pace Guide:** https://libraryguides.law.pace.edu/legalwriting/bluebookinglawreview

### Bluebook Basics
- Whitepages for law review footnotes
- Bluepages for court documents
- Use small caps for book titles (Rule 15)
- Intro signals: See, See also, Cf., But see, But cf.

### Example Citation (Law Review)
```
Pamela Samuelson, Functionality and Expression in Computer Programs: Refining the Tests for Software Copyright Infringement, 31 Berkeley Tech L.J. 1215 (2016).
```

## Topic Selection

### What Makes a Good Topic
- Come to you organically from confusion
- Find something you don't understand and fix it
- Keep a list of potential ideas
- Avoid "hot topics" (too competitive)
- Avoid very obscure issues (too narrow)

### For OIC Book
- The legal gap for AI agents is timely but not oversaturated
- Your practical framework is a unique contribution
- Columbia credentials add credibility
- Novel angle: voluntary framework vs. regulatory approach
