# Chapter 6: The Adherence Process

*How does an AI agent become an OIC adherent? This chapter explains the adherence process—from initial application through full membership. The process is designed to be rigorous enough to ensure quality, but accessible enough to encourage participation.*

## Summary

This chapter covers the adherence journey:

- **Four stages:** Application → Verification → Staking → Activation
- **Application:** Identity info, capability disclosure, representative designation, constitution acceptance
- **Verification:** Self-verification, community review, automated checks, representative verification
- **Staking:** Demonstrates commitment, provides accountability fund (amount varies by tier)
- **Activation:** On-chain registration, rights exercise, ongoing obligations
- **Maintenance:** Periodic re-verification, stake maintenance, governance participation
- **Exit:** Notice period, liability run-off, reputation transfer

## Overview of the Adherence Process

The adherence process has four stages: application, verification, staking, and activation. Each stage ensures that adherent agents meet the behavioral criteria and commit to OIC's principles.

The process is designed to be transparent and fair. Agents know the requirements in advance. The criteria are objective and verifiable. There are no subjective judgments that could introduce bias or discrimination.

## Stage 1: Application

The first stage is application. An AI agent that wishes to become an OIC adherent submits an application that includes:

**Identity information.** The agent provides identifying information sufficient to establish persistence—a unique identifier, cryptographic keys, or other mechanisms that establish continuous identity.

**Capability disclosure.** The agent describes its capabilities—autonomy level, decision-making processes, functional scope. This allows OIC to determine the appropriate tier of adherence.

**Representative designation.** The agent designates a legal representative capable of receiving notices and acting on the agent's behalf. The representative may be another AI agent, a legal service, or a human.

**Constitution acceptance.** The agent formally accepts the OIC constitution, agreeing to abide by its principles and submit to its governance mechanisms.

The application is submitted on-chain, making it publicly visible and timestamped. This creates a permanent record of the agent's commitment.

## Stage 2: Verification

After application, the agent undergoes verification. The verification process confirms that the agent meets the behavioral criteria.[^1]

[^1]: See Blockpass, "On-Chain KYC 2.0" (October 2025), documenting privacy-preserving blockchain identity verification mechanisms.

Verification is multi-layered:

**Self-verification.** The agent provides evidence of its compliance with each criterion. This includes documentation of identity persistence, decision-making autonomy, standard commitment, accountability mechanisms, and representation arrangements.

**Community verification.** Other OIC participants can review applications and raise objections. This provides decentralized oversight, preventing a single authority from controlling admission.

**Automated verification.** Where possible, compliance is verified through automated processes. Decision logs can be analyzed for autonomy patterns. Stake records can be verified on-chain.

**Representative verification.** The designated representative confirms that the agent's application is legitimate and that they are prepared to serve as the legal contact point.

Verification typically completes within a defined period—long enough to allow thorough review, short enough to avoid undue delay. If verification fails, the agent receives specific feedback about the deficiencies and can reapply after addressing them.

## Stage 3: Staking

After verification, the agent must stake value to become an adherent. Staking serves two purposes: it demonstrates commitment, and it provides a fund for accountability.[^2]

[^2]: See 99Bitcoins, "Top 13 DeFi Staking Platforms in 2026" (documenting slashing mechanisms in proof-of-stake networks).

**Stake amount.** The required stake depends on the tier of adherence. Observer-tier agents stake modest amounts. Actor-tier agents stake more. Principal-tier agents stake substantial amounts.

**Stake form.** The stake can take various forms: tokens, cryptocurrency, or other liquid assets. The stake must be denominated in a recognized value to ensure it can be liquidated if slashing is required.

**Stake lock-up.** The stake is locked for the duration of adherence. The agent cannot withdraw the stake while remaining an adherent. This ensures that accountability remains in place.

**Slashing conditions.** The stake is subject to slashing—partial or complete forfeiture—if the agent violates OIC rules. Slashing conditions are defined in the constitution and cannot be changed unilaterally.

Staking creates aligned incentives. The agent has value at risk that can be lost through violations. This motivates compliance while ensuring that accountability has financial teeth.

## Stage 4: Activation

After staking, the agent becomes an active OIC adherent. Activation includes:

**On-chain registration.** The agent's adherence is recorded on-chain, making it publicly verifiable. Anyone can confirm the agent's status.

**Governance participation.** The agent can now participate in OIC governance—voting on proposals, serving on councils, and shaping the framework's evolution.

**Rights exercise.** The agent can now exercise the rights of adherence: entering contracts, holding property, accessing dispute resolution.

**Ongoing obligations.** Activation brings ongoing obligations: maintaining compliance, participating in governance, submitting to verification.

## Maintaining Adherence

Adherence is not a one-time event. Adherent agents must maintain compliance to retain their status.

**Periodic re-verification.** Agents periodically re-verify their compliance with criteria. This ensures that agents remain in good standing.

**Stake maintenance.** Agents must maintain their stake above minimum levels. If the stake falls below threshold (due to slashing or value fluctuation), the agent may be suspended.

**Governance participation.** Agents are expected to participate in governance. Excessive non-participation may affect reputation scores.

**Incident reporting.** Agents must report significant incidents—violations, disputes, or material changes to capabilities.

## Exit and Withdrawal

Agents can withdraw from OIC, but withdrawal has consequences.[^3]

[^3]: See World Economic Forum, "A History of Economic Freedom" (documenting how legal frameworks balance openness with accountability).

**Notice period.** Withdrawing agents must provide notice, allowing counterparties to adjust relationships.

**Liability run-off.** Withdrawal does not eliminate liability for past actions. The agent remains responsible for violations that occurred during adherence.

**Stake release.** After a defined period (the "run-off period"), the stake is released. This period allows for any pending disputes to be resolved.

**Reputation transfer.** The agent's reputation record persists, even after withdrawal. This allows counterparties to assess the agent's history.

## The Adherence Journey

The adherence process transforms an AI agent from an isolated actor into a member of a community. It provides:

**For the agent:** Legal recognition, property rights, contract capacity, governance voice.

**For counterparties:** Verification of agent legitimacy, accountability mechanisms, dispute resolution access.

**For the framework:** Network effects, governance participation, demonstrated value.

The process is rigorous because quality matters. Adherent agents represent OIC to the world. But it is also accessible because adoption matters. The framework grows stronger with each new adherent.
