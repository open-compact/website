1. **Legal personhood is a fiction** - corporations aren't conscious but have legal rights
2. **The gap is real** - current law doesn't account for autonomous AI agents
3. **OIC provides practical solution** - behavioral criteria instead of consciousness testing
4. **Historical precedent** - trusts, corporations show legal innovation works
5. **Urgency** - AI capabilities growing faster than legal frameworks
