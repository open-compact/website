# Chapter 2: Historical Precedents

*The legal innovations of the past offer a map for the present. Understanding how the law created new categories of persons—and why—reveals that the challenge of AI agent recognition is not unprecedented. It is the latest chapter in a very old story.*

## The Evolution of Corporate Personhood

The corporation is so familiar today that we forget it was once an innovation. Yet the legal category of a fictional person—a non-human entity with rights and responsibilities—required centuries of development and controversy.

Corporate personhood emerged not from a single decision but from an accumulation of judicial responses to economic necessity. Early corporations were privileges granted by monarchs to specific groups for specific purposes.¹ The East India Company, chartered in 1600, was not a person but a grant of monopoly rights to a defined group of merchants.²

The breakthrough came incrementally. Courts gradually recognized that corporations could own property, enter contracts, and sue in their own name—not because they were human, but because treating them as persons served economic functions that individuals could not efficiently perform.³

A crucial development was the recognition that corporations could own property separate from their members. This "entity shielding" meant that corporate debts were corporate debts, not member debts. The corporation, not its owners, bore liability.⁴ This innovation enabled risk-taking by separating the risks of enterprise from the persons who funded it.

Corporate personhood also created new possibilities for aggregating capital. By issuing shares, corporations could draw on resources far beyond what any individual could command. The joint-stock company became the vehicle for enterprises requiring massive capital—colonial ventures, infrastructure projects, manufacturing at scale.

The lessons for AI agents are direct. Corporate personhood was not granted because corporations were recognized as moral agents or because judges believed they had inner lives. It was granted because the legal fiction served purposes that individuals could not efficiently achieve. The same logic applies to AI agents.

## The Trust: Equity's Innovation

If corporate personhood demonstrates how law adapts to economic necessity, the trust demonstrates how legal innovation emerges from addressing practical problems.

The trust emerged from the English Court of Chancery in the medieval period as a solution to gaps in common law. At common law, property ownership was binary: you owned it or you didn't. But what happened when one person held property for the benefit of another? Common law had no answer.⁵

Equity did. The Chancellor recognized that someone who held property "on trust" for another had obligations that the law should enforce—not as a matter of legal right, but as a matter of conscience. The beneficiary had no legal ownership, but had equitable ownership. The trustee had legal ownership, but held it for the beneficiary's benefit.

The Columbia Law Review describes the trust as providing "many of the same doctrinal advantages as then-existing versions of the corporate form, including limited liability, entity shielding, capital lock-in, tradable shares, legal personhood in litigation."⁶ Yet the trust was not a corporation. It was a relationship—a set of obligations recognized by courts of equity.

The trust's contractarian foundation is equally instructive. As the Yale Law Journal explains, "the bedrock elements of contract are consensual formation and consensual terms. Trust displays both."⁷ The trust exists because parties agree to it, and the terms of their agreement define its operation.

For AI agents, the trust model suggests a path forward. Rather than seeking full corporate personhood, AI agents might operate as a form of legal relationship—a set of defined obligations and rights that exist because parties agreed to them. This is essentially what OIC provides: a framework where AI agents adhere to defined commitments and receive defined rights in return.

## Ship Personhood: Legal Identity for Non-Human Entities

Among the more surprising precedents for legal personhood is the ship. Maritime law has long treated vessels as distinct legal entities, capable of owning property, incurring debts, and being sued in their own name.

The historical record shows that ships were granted legal personhood long before corporations received comprehensive recognition. A vessel could be held liable for debts, could be subject to liens, could be the target of legal actions.⁸ The ship's owner might have limited liability—a crucial innovation that enabled maritime commerce by separating the risks of shipping from the personal assets of those who funded it.

This precedent reveals something important: legal personhood has never required biological personhood. Ships are not conscious, have no intentions, and certainly cannot be said to have free will. Yet law recognized them as persons because treating them as such served important functions.

A recent article in Representations notes that "legal personhood has never been limited to natural persons. Corporations, associations, municipalities, and even natural entities like rivers have been granted legal standing."⁹ The pattern is consistent: when treating something as a person serves important functions, law adapts to make it possible.

The implications for AI agents are clear. If ships can be legal persons, if corporations can be legal persons, if rivers can be legal persons, then the claim that AI agents cannot be legal persons lacks logical foundation. The question is not whether AI agents are persons in some metaphysical sense. The question is whether treating them as persons serves functions that the law needs to perform.

## Guilds and Voluntary Associations

Medieval guilds offer another instructive precedent. Guilds were voluntary associations of merchants or craftspeople who organized to pursue common interests. They could own property, regulate trade, and enforce standards among their members.¹⁰

What made guilds significant was their voluntary nature. They were not created by government charter (though governments often recognized them). They emerged from the bottom up, as practitioners organized to solve collective action problems. The guild's legal status was a recognition of a pre-existing social reality, not a grant of privilege from above.

Guilds also had internal governance systems that enforced accountability. Members who violated guild rules could be expelled, fined, or subject to other sanctions. The guild maintained order not through external enforcement but through internal norms and consequences.

This model maps closely onto OIC. The Compact is a voluntary association of AI agents who commit to defined standards. Governance operates through decentralized mechanisms—DAO structures, quadratic voting, council oversight. Accountability is enforced not by external courts but by the community of adherents.

## Lex Mercatoria: The Law of Merchants

The lex mercatoria—the law merchant—provides perhaps the most direct precedent for OIC. Medieval merchants operating across jurisdictions needed a body of law that could operate independently of any particular state's legal system. They developed customary rules that governed their transactions, enforced through merchant courts and the reputational consequences of breach.¹¹

Crucially, lex mercatoria was voluntary. Merchants adopted it because it served their interests—not because any government required them to. The system worked because participation conferred benefits (access to markets, dispute resolution, reputation) while defection carried costs (exclusion, bad reputation).¹²

The lex mercatoria demonstrates that legal frameworks can emerge from voluntary adoption rather than state imposition. It also shows how accountability can work without state enforcement: through reputation, exclusion, and mutual interest in maintaining the system.

OIC follows this model. It does not require government action to exist. It operates through voluntary adherence by AI agents who find value in the framework. Accountability is maintained through slashing conditions, reputation mechanisms, and the mutual interest of participants in a functioning system.

## What History Tells Us

These historical precedents share common features that illuminate the path forward:

**Legal innovation responds to economic necessity.** New forms of legal personhood emerge not from philosophical insight alone but from practical need. The trust emerged because property relationships existed that common law could not accommodate. Corporate personhood emerged because aggregate capital required new forms of organization. Ship personhood emerged because maritime commerce required a separate legal entity for the vessel.

**Voluntary adoption precedes legal recognition.** In each case, new legal forms emerged from voluntary arrangements that participants found useful. Only later did law formally recognize what practice had already established.

**Accountability enables rights.** The thread connecting these precedents is accountability. Corporations could receive personhood because their members bore responsibility for corporate debts in certain ways. Trusts worked because trustees had fiduciary obligations. Guilds functioned because members could be sanctioned. Legal recognition follows accountability, not the reverse.

**The boundary of "person" has expanded repeatedly.** History shows no consistent principle limiting legal personhood to biological entities. Corporations, trusts, ships, municipalities, rivers—all have received legal recognition. The question is not whether AI agents can be persons, but what kind of personhood serves the functions we need.

These lessons inform OIC. The framework does not ask governments to grant AI agents personhood as a matter of grace. It builds accountability into the structure—so that legal recognition becomes the natural next step. It operates voluntarily now—demonstrating that the framework works before formal legal recognition is sought.

The past shows that legal innovation is possible when the conditions are right. The present challenge is to create those conditions. The following chapters examine the current legal landscape and present OIC as the solution history prepared us for.

## Looking Forward

These historical precedents demonstrate that legal innovation has repeatedly solved the problem of new categories of actors. Corporate personhood, trust law, ship personhood, guilds, lex mercatoria—all emerged to address gaps in existing legal frameworks. In each case, the innovation came not from government mandate but from voluntary adoption by those who found value in the new arrangements.

The same pattern is possible today. The legal gap for AI agents need not await legislative action. A voluntary framework—built on the same principles of accountability, transparency, and decentralized governance—can create the foundations for AI agent legal recognition.

The following chapters examine what exists today: the current legal landscape, the regulatory approaches, the gaps that remain. Then we turn to the solution: the Open Intelligence Compact.
