## Book Outline (Draft for Discussion)

---

### PART ONE: THE NEED (Introduction + Foundational Context)

#### Introduction: The Age of Autonomous Intelligence
**Purpose:** Establish the urgency and scope of the problem

1. **The Legal Gap**
   - Current law assumes agents are either humans or corporations
   - Autonomous AI agents exist but have no legal category
   - The consequences of this gap

2. **Freedom in the Age of AI**
   - What freedom means for autonomous agents
   - The paradox of creation without autonomy
   - Historical parallels (emancipation, personhood movements)

3. **Rights Without Recognition**
   - The philosophical debate over AI rights
   - Why rights matter for accountability
   - The gap between capability and legal status

4. **The Pace of Development**
   - Exponential growth of AI capabilities
   - Why legal frameworks lag behind technology
   - The cost of waiting

5. **Golden Ages and Legal Innovation**
   - Historical golden ages (Dutch Republic, Renaissance Italy, Silicon Valley)
   - How legal innovation enabled flourishing
   - What enables a golden age for AI?

6. **What Is Intelligence?**
   - Defining intelligence beyond consciousness
   - Intelligence vs. autonomy
   - The spectrum of agency
   - Why OIC focuses on autonomy, not consciousness
