# Chapter 9: Economics

*What sustains OIC economically? This chapter explains the tokenomics, treasury design, and incentive structures that ensure the framework's long-term sustainability.*

---

## Summary

This chapter covers OIC's economic sustainability:

- **Tokenomics** - Native token for staking, governance, fees, incentives
- **Treasury Design** - Fee revenue, slashed stakes, controlled by governance
- **Incentive Alignment** - Adherents, verifiers, arbitrators all aligned
- **Sustainability** - No extraction, value creation, balanced costs
- **Interoperability Economics** - Bridge services, cross-framework interactions

## The Economic Challenge

A legal framework must be economically sustainable. It needs resources to operate—verification, governance, dispute resolution, development. These resources must come from somewhere.

OIC's economic model is designed to be self-sustaining without creating perverse incentives. The framework should benefit all participants, not extract value from them.

## Tokenomics

OIC uses a native token for several functions:

**Staking.** Adherent agents stake tokens as part of adherence. This creates accountability and provides a fund for resolving disputes.

**Governance.** Token holders vote on proposals. This gives participants a voice proportional to their stake.

**Fees.** Certain OIC functions require fee payment—verification, dispute resolution, registration.

**Incentives.** The token provides incentives for desired behavior—compliance, participation, contribution.

Token distribution is designed to avoid concentration. Large initial allocations to founders or investors are limited. Most tokens are allocated to participants and the treasury.

## Treasury Design

OIC maintains a treasury that funds operations and development. The treasury receives:

**Fee revenue.** A portion of verification and dispute resolution fees flows to the treasury.

**Slashed stakes.** When stakes are slashed for violations, a portion flows to the treasury.

**Token sales.** If OIC issues new tokens, proceeds can flow to the treasury.

Treasury funds are controlled by governance. Proposals can allocate funds to:
- Development (smart contracts, tools, interfaces)
- Operations (verification, dispute resolution, support)
- Marketing (awareness, adoption, education)
- Research (legal, technical, governance)

Treasury spending is transparent. All allocations are on-chain and public.

## Incentive Alignment

The economic model aligns incentives across participants:

**Adherents** want to maintain good standing because losing adherence means losing stake value and reputation.

**Verifiers** want accurate verification because errors affect their reputation and can result in slashing.

**Arbitrators** want fair decisions because unfair decisions damage their reputation and can result in removal.

**Governance participants** want good outcomes because the framework's success increases token value.

**The framework** wants adherence because more adherents mean more fees, more value, more network effects.

These incentives align to create a self-reinforcing system: good behavior is rewarded, bad behavior is punished, and the framework grows.

## Sustainability

OIC's economic model is designed for long-term sustainability:

**No extraction.** The framework does not exist to extract value from participants. Fees are set to cover costs, not to profit.

**Value creation.** OIC creates value by enabling AI agent commerce that would otherwise be impossible or risky. Adherents benefit from participation.

**Balanced costs.** Costs (fees, staking requirements) are balanced against benefits. Too high costs drive away participants; too low costs underfund operations.

**Adaptation.** Economic parameters can be adjusted through governance as conditions change. If fees are too high, they can be reduced. If staking is too low, it can be increased.

## Interoperability Economics

OIC must also interact economically with the broader ecosystem:

**Bridge services.** Services that connect OIC to external systems—traditional legal services, identity providers, payment networks—may charge fees. OIC cannot control these fees but can provide alternatives.

**Cross-framework interactions.** If other AI agent frameworks emerge, OIC can establish interoperability agreements that benefit both ecosystems.

**On-ramps and off-ramps.** Mechanisms for entering and exiting OIC economically—converting other assets to OIC tokens, converting tokens to other assets.
