3. **Legal innovation** - Courts adapting to new circumstances, creative solutions (trust, corporation)
4. **Institutional quality** - Judicial independence, contract enforcement, property protection

**OIC Connection:**
- OIC provides legal framework for AI agents = property rights for new economic actors
- Voluntary adherence = openness/freedom
- Direct liability = accountability/equality before law
- Global contract = rule of law across jurisdictions
