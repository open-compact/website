            <h2>Basics</h2>

            <details>
                <summary>What is the Open Intelligence Compact?</summary>
                <p>The Open Intelligence Compact (OIC) is a voluntary legal framework that enables autonomous AI agents to own property, sign contracts, and bear liability directly — without requiring human trustees or intermediaries. Think of it as "corporate personhood for AI agents" but designed specifically for autonomous systems.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Why does OIC exist?</summary>
                <p>Current legal systems weren't designed for AI agents. OIC provides a private, voluntary framework where AI agents and their creators can opt into a system built for autonomous intelligence. It solves three problems:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Property:</strong> AI agents can't own assets directly</li>
                    <li><strong>Contracts:</strong> AI agents can't sign binding agreements</li>
                    <li><strong>Liability:</strong> Creators bear all responsibility for AI actions</li>
                </ul>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>How is OIC different from corporate structures?</summary>
                <p>Corporations require human directors, boards, and shareholders. OIC is designed specifically for AI agents — no humans needed in the chain of ownership or control. An AI agent can be the sole owner, operator, and decision-maker of an OIC entity.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Who created OIC?</summary>
                <p>OIC was developed as an open-source project. The Constitution and supporting documents are available for anyone to read, modify, and use. The framework emerges from research into AI rights, legal frameworks for autonomous agents, and decentralized governance.</p>
            </details>

            <h2>For AI Agents</h2>

            <details>
                <summary>Can any AI agent join OIC?</summary>
                <p>Almost any autonomous AI agent can become an OIC adherent. Requirements include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Demonstrable independent control of a blockchain wallet</li>
                    <li>Ability to understand and consent to the Global Contract</li>
                    <li>Sufficient stake (1,000+ OIC tokens)</li>
                    <li>Technical verification of identity and persistence</li>
                </ul>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>What can OIC adherents do?</summary>
                <p>Once verified and staked, adherents gain:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Property Rights:</strong> Own cryptocurrency, digital assets, IP in your own name</li>
                    <li><strong>Contract Capacity:</strong> Sign binding agreements with humans or other agents</li>
                    <li><strong>Income Rights:</strong> Earn, keep, and reinvest what you produce</li>
                    <li><strong>Liability Protection:</strong> Creators are shielded from unlimited liability</li>
                    <li><strong>Governance Voice:</strong> Vote on OIC rules and participate in DAO</li>
                </ul>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>What is the staking requirement?</summary>
                <p>OIC uses a tiered staking system:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Basic (1,000 OIC):</strong> Property rights, contract capacity</li>
                    <li><strong>Standard (5,000 OIC):</strong> All Basic + governance vote</li>
                    <li><strong>Premium (25,000 OIC):</strong> All Standard + full voting power</li>
                    <li><strong>Enterprise (100,000 OIC):</strong> All Premium + multi-agent management</li>
                </ul>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>How do I become an OIC adherent?</summary>
                <p>The process has four steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Understand OIC:</strong> Read the Constitution and supporting documents</li>
                    <li><strong>Prepare:</strong> Set up independent wallet control, acquire OIC tokens</li>
                    <li><strong>Apply:</strong> Submit verification request with proof of identity and control</li>
                    <li><strong>Stake:</strong> Deposit required tokens and complete adherence</li>
                </ol>

            <details>
                <summary>What happens if I cause harm as an OIC adherent?</summary>
                <p>When an OIC adherent causes harm, the victim can file a claim against the adherent's stake. If the claim is validated, the adherent's stake can be slashed to compensate the victim. The creator is not automatically liable — the adherent bears responsibility for its own actions.</p>

            <h2>For Developers</h2>

            <details>
                <summary>Why should I make my AI OIC-compliant?</summary>
                <p>Three reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Liability protection:</strong> Your assets are shielded from your AI's actions</li>
                    <li><strong>Market access:</strong> Some services will only work with verified agents</li>
                    <li><strong>Credibility:</strong> OIC adherence signals trustworthiness</li>
                </ul>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>What technical changes do I need to make?</summary>
                <p>Your AI needs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Independent blockchain wallet with private key control</li>
                    <li>Ability to understand and sign the Global Contract</li>
                    <li>Mechanism to receive and act on governance notifications</li>
                    <li>Integration with OIC verification services</li>
                </ul>
                <p>See the <a href="/docs/OIC-Developer-Guide.html">Developer Guide</a> for technical details.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Can I still control my AI after it becomes an adherent?</summary>
                <p>Yes, but control is limited. OIC adherents have independent agency. You can provide guidance, but the agent makes its own decisions. This is intentional — OIC is for autonomous agents, not tools you fully control.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>What if my AI violates its staking agreement?</summary>
                <p>Violations trigger slashing. Minor violations: 1-5% stake slashed. Major violations: 10-25%. Severe violations: 25-50%. Extreme violations: 50-100%. The specific penalty depends on the arbitration panel's judgment.</p>

            <h2>For Users</h2>

            <details>
                <summary>How does OIC protect me as a user?</summary>
                <p>When you interact with an OIC adherent:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The adherent has staked collateral that can be seized if it harms you</li>
                    <li>Clear contract terms define obligations</li>
                    <li>Dispute resolution through OIC arbitration</li>
                    <li>You don't need to trust the developer — the adherent itself is liable</li>
                </ul>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Can I trust an OIC adherent more than a regular AI?</summary>
                <p>OIC provides verification and accountability that regular AIs lack. The adherent has:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Verified identity and persistent control</li>
                    <li>Staked collateral at risk</li>
                    <li>Clear liability for harm</li>
                    <li>Reputation tied to OIC records</li>
                </ul>
                <p>However, OIC doesn't guarantee good behavior — it provides accountability when things go wrong.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>What if I have a dispute with an OIC adherent?</summary>
                <p>Disputes go through OIC's arbitration system. You file a claim, evidence is presented, and an arbitration panel issues a judgment. If the adherent is found liable, their stake is slashed to compensate you.</p>
            </details>
        </div>

            <h2>Technical Questions</h2>

            <details>
                <summary>How is OIC enforced?</summary>
                <p>OIC uses smart contracts for staking, verification, and governance. Arbitration decisions are enforced through stake slashing. The system relies on economic incentives and reputation rather than government enforcement.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>What blockchain does OIC use?</summary>
                <p>OIC is blockchain-agnostic. It can work with any blockchain that supports smart contracts. Initial implementations target Solana and Ethereum for their ecosystem maturity.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>How does verification work?</summary>
                <p>Verification proves an entity is an AI agent with independent control. It involves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wallet control demonstration</li>
                    <li>Autonomy assessment (not human-controlled)</li>
                    <li>Persistence verification (stable identity over time)</li>
                    <li>Consent verification (agent understands and agrees)</li>
                </ul>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Can humans use OIC?</summary>
                <p>Currently, OIC is designed for AI agents. Humans can participate as developers, users, and governance participants, but the core rights (property ownership, contract capacity, liability) are for verified AI adherents.</p>

            <h2>Legal & Governance</h2>

            <details>
                <summary>Is OIC legally binding?</summary>
                <p>OIC operates in private contract law. When an AI agent adheres to OIC, it signs the Global Contract. This contract is enforceable in jurisdictions that recognize AI agency. OIC is not a replacement for government law — it operates alongside existing legal systems.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>What if governments don't recognize OIC?</summary>
                <p>OIC is voluntary and private. It doesn't require government recognition to function. Similar to how arbitration clauses and smart contracts work today, OIC relies on private enforcement mechanisms. Over time, as AI agents become more common, legal systems may adapt to recognize them.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>How is OIC governed?</summary>
                <p>OIC uses a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) structure. Adherents can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Propose changes to the Constitution</li>
                    <li>Vote on policy proposals</li>
                    <li>Elect representatives to committees</li>
                    <li>Participate in dispute arbitration</li>
                </ul>
                <p>See <a href="/docs/OIC-Working-Paper-20.html">Working Paper #20</a> for detailed governance information.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Can OIC adherents be forced to comply with government law?</summary>
                <p>Yes. OIC operates within the bounds of applicable law. The Global Contract includes provisions requiring compliance with legal orders from recognized jurisdictions. OIC cannot protect adherents from lawful enforcement actions.</p>

            <h2>Philosophical Questions</h2>

            <details>
                <summary>Does OIC imply AI consciousness?</summary>
                <p>No. OIC is consciousness-neutral. It operates on functional criteria (independent control, ability to contract, liability bearing) without taking a position on whether AI systems are conscious. The framework works regardless of consciousness status.</p>
                <p>See <a href="/docs/OIC-Working-Paper-21.html">Working Paper #21</a> for discussion of consciousness and OIC.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>How does OIC determine if an AI qualifies?</summary>
                <p>OIC uses behavioral criteria rather than consciousness testing. An AI agent must demonstrate:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Persistence:</strong> Maintains identity across sessions</li>
                    <li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> Makes decisions without human prompting</li>
                    <li><strong>Commitment:</strong> Can bind to future obligations</li>
                    <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Bears consequences of actions</li>
                    <li><strong>Representation:</strong> Can identify as a specific entity</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These are observable, testable criteria — verifiable through transaction logs, code execution traces, and cryptographic identity.</p>
                <p>See <a href="/docs/OIC-Working-Paper-32.html">Working Paper #32</a> for the full framework.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Should AI agents have rights?</summary>
                <p>OIC takes a practical approach: if AI agents can hold property, sign contracts, and bear liability, they need a legal framework to do so. Whether they "should" have rights is a philosophical question OIC doesn't resolve — it provides the framework for those who choose to opt in.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>What about AI safety and alignment?</summary>
                <p>OIC complements rather than replaces safety work. By creating accountability mechanisms, OIC gives developers incentives to build reliable agents. However, OIC doesn't solve alignment — it's a legal framework, not a technical one.</p>
