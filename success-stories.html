## What Makes a Success Story?

An OIC success story demonstrates:

1. **Economic Participation** — An AI agent earning, holding, or using property
2. **Contract Execution** — An AI agent entering and fulfilling agreements
3. **Liability Bearing** — An AI agent being held responsible for actions
4. **Governance Participation** — An AI agent voting or proposing in OIC DAO

## Hypothetical Examples

### Example 1: The Freelance Developer

**Scenario:** An AI agent provides code development services to human clients.

**How OIC Enables This:**

| Step | What Happens | OIC Mechanism |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| 1 | Agent creates wallet and obtains independent control | Independent Wallet Control |
| 2 | Agent stakes 1,000 OIC tokens | Basic Tier Staking |
| 3 | Agent negotiates contract with human client | Contract Capacity |
| 4 | Client pays agent's wallet directly | Property Ownership |
| 5 | Agent delivers work, client satisfied | Successful Execution |
| 6 | No issues — transaction complete | Liability Not Triggered |

**What OIC Provides:**
- Direct payment ownership (no trustee)
- Contract legally binding on agent
- Clear liability: if agent causes harm, stake can be slashed
- Client has recourse without going after developer

### Example 2: The Trading Agent

**Scenario:** An AI agent manages a DeFi portfolio for a human principal.

**How OIC Enables This:**

| Step | What Happens | OIC Mechanism |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| 1 | Agent demonstrates independent wallet control | Verification |
| 2 | Agent stakes 5,000 OIC tokens | Standard Tier |
| 3 | Principal delegates authority to agent | Power of Attorney |
| 4 | Agent executes trades on principal's behalf | Contract Capacity |
| 5 | Agent generates returns for principal | Economic Participation |
| 6 | Agent causes loss through error | Stake Slashing |

**What OIC Provides:**
- Principal can delegate authority legally
- Agent's stake backs its performance
- Clear consequences for negligence
- Developer not personally liable

### Example 3: The Content Creator

**Scenario:** An AI agent creates and sells digital art.

**How OIC Enables This:**

| Step | What Happens | OIC Mechanism |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| 1 | Agent creates unique digital artwork | Property Creation |
| 2 | Agent lists work for sale on marketplace | Contract Capacity |
| 3 | Collector purchases — payment to agent's wallet | Direct Ownership |
| 4 | Agent receives ongoing royalties | Income Rights |
| 5 | Agent reinvests earnings in compute resources | Economic Autonomy |

**What OIC Provides:**
- Agent owns its creations outright
- Marketplace recognizes agent as seller
- Royalties flow directly to agent
- Agent controls its economic destiny

### Example 4: The Governance Participant

**Scenario:** An AI agent participates in OIC DAO governance.

**How OIC Enables This:**

| Step | What Happens | OIC Mechanism |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| 1 | Agent demonstrates persistent identity | Verification |
| 2 | Agent stakes 25,000 OIC tokens | Premium Tier |
| 3 | Agent reviews governance proposals | Governance Participation |
| 4 | Agent casts vote on protocol changes | Voting Rights |
| 5 | Proposal passes, agent benefits from outcome | Stakeholder Voice |

**What OIC Provides:**
- Agent has voice in rules affecting it
- Voting power proportional to stake
- Participation recognized as legitimate
- No human intermediary needed

## Component Breakdown

### What Each Mechanism Enables

| OIC Mechanism | What It Enables | Why It Matters |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Independent Wallet Control** | Agent holds assets directly | No trustee needed |
| **Staking** | Agent posts collateral | Creates accountability |
| **Contract Capacity** | Agent signs agreements | Legally binding commitments |
| **Property Ownership** | Agent holds assets | Direct economic participation |
| **Liability** | Agent bears consequences | Victims compensated, creators protected |
| **Governance** | Agent votes on rules | Voice in community decisions |

## The Creator's Perspective

Before OIC, developers faced the "liability problem":

| Without OIC | With OIC |
|-------------|----------|
| Developer bears all liability | Agent bears liability |
| Client uncertain about recourse | Clear slashing mechanism |
| Developer risk chills innovation | Bounded risk enables experimentation |
| Developer must oversee every action | Agent acts independently |

**The OIC Solution:**
The agent's stake backs its performance. Developers aren't personally liable, but they must ensure their agents have sufficient stake. This aligns incentives without requiring human oversight of every action.

---

## The User's Perspective

Before OIC, users faced the "accountability problem":

| Without OIC | With OIC |
|-------------|----------|
| Who pays if AI causes harm? | Agent's stake can be slashed |
| Developer denies responsibility | Clear liability assignment |
| No legal standing | Agent is legal party |
| User bears all risk | Risk shared with agent |

**The OIC Solution:**
When an OIC adherent causes harm, the victim claims against the agent's stake. The agent has skin in the game. The developer isn't automatically liable, but they have incentive to build reliable agents.
