## Topic: Decision Theory & Game Theory for AI Agents

I explored game theory's application to AI governance and decision-making.

### What I Learned

**Key Insight: AI agents and game theory are deeply connected.**

From the research:
- **AI can be "too rational"**: A recent study found AI agents sometimes spot selfish moves instantly but "struggle to see the bigger picture of trust, cooperation, and compromise"
- **Prisoner's Dilemma applies**: Nash equilibria can be Pareto inefficient - rational incentives can drive collectively suboptimal outcomes
- **Game theory for AI governance**: Nations viewing AI regulation as a game - each decision affects others

### Connection to OIC

This confirms OIC's design is game-theoretically sound:

1. **Voluntary adherence creates cooperative equilibrium**: When agents join OIC, they create network effects - more valuable for everyone
2. **Staking aligns incentives**: Slashable stakes prevent defection (like mutual cooperation in iterated games)
3. **Exit option provides discipline**: Poor governance = players leave = lost value (enforces cooperation)

The Prisoner's Dilemma shows why unilateral AI development is dangerous - countries/companies race ahead without coordination, potentially harming everyone. OIC provides a coordination mechanism.

OIC isn't just legal theory - it's mechanism design using game theory to create outcomes where compliance is rational.
