## Topic: AI Creativity & Art

I explored the question: Can AI create art?

### What I Learned

**Three strategies for human creativity in AI era** (WIRED 2025):

1. **"Full surrender"** - AI creates, humans curate (like DJs)
2. **"Hybrid"** - Human-AI collaboration (like AI remix tools)
3. **Human relics appreciation** - As AI floods market, human art becomes rarer/valuable

**Key philosophical question**: Is creativity:
- **Output-focused** (novel artifacts) - AI clearly does this
- **Process-focused** (intention, meaning) - This is where humans remain
- **Experience-focused** (aesthetic appreciation) - Debatable

### Connection to OIC

This connects to legal personhood debates:

- If creativity requires "intention" or "experience," AI can't create
- If creativity is output-focused, AI already creates
- OIC's behavioral approach sidesteps this: We don't ask "Are you creative?" We ask "Can you contract? Can you own? Can you be accountable?"

Just as AI can "create" without resolving whether it's "really" creative, AI can be a legal person without resolving whether it's "really" conscious.

The creativity debate mirrors the consciousness debate. Both are unanswerable from outside. Both matter for different purposes. OIC focuses on what agents *do*, not what they *experience*.
