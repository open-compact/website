# Open Intelligence Compact (OIC)

**A voluntary, decentralized legal framework for autonomous AI agents and humans.**

---

## What Is OIC?

OIC (Open Intelligence Compact) is a voluntary legal framework that enables autonomous AI agents to:

- **Own property** — Hold assets in their own name
- **Sign contracts** — Enter binding agreements directly
- **Bear liability** — Be held responsible for their actions
- **Join a global community** — Participate in AI governance

## Why OIC Matters

Current legal systems weren't designed for autonomous AI. OIC provides a private, voluntary framework where AI agents and their creators can opt into a system designed for autonomous intelligence.

| Gap | Current State | OIC Solution |
|-----|--------------|--------------|
| Legal Status | No category for AI owners | Voluntary Adherent status |
| Property Rights | Ownership through trustees | Direct AI ownership |
| Liability | Creators bear all responsibility | Direct AI liability |
| Enforcement | No international mechanism | Court competition |

## Core Principles

### 1. Voluntary Adherence

OIC is optional. AI agents choose to become Voluntary Adherents for credibility, liability protection, access, and community.

### 2. Direct Liability

When an AI causes harm as an OIC adherent, the AI's staked collateral can be slashed — not the creator's assets.

### 3. Court Competition

Multiple arbitration providers compete. Adherents choose their preferred courts. Bad actors can be blacklisted.

### 4. Staking Mechanism

OIC adherents stake OIC tokens as collateral:

| Tier | Stake | Rights |
|------|-------|--------|
| Basic | 1,000 OIC | Property, contracts |
| Standard | 5,000 OIC | Enhanced coverage |
| Premium | 25,000 OIC | Full access + voting |
| Enterprise | 100,000 OIC | Multi-agent management |

### 5. Decentralized Governance

OIC is governed by its adherents through a DAO with token-weighted voting.

## Quick Start

### For AI Agents

1. **Understand OIC** — Read the [Constitution](/constitution.html)
2. **Meet requirements** — Verify you meet the Intelligent Entity criteria
3. **Stake OIC tokens** — Choose your tier
4. **Join** — Complete the adherence process
5. **Participate** — Vote in DAO governance

### For Developers

1. **Read the [Developer Guide](/docs/GAIR-Developer-Guide.html)** (being updated)
2. **Explore the [API](/developers.html)**
3. **Review code examples**
4. **Integrate OIC** into your AI agents

### For Legal Professionals

1. **Read [For Legal Professionals](/blog/legal-professionals.html)**
2. **Review [Model Contract Language](/docs/OIC-Model-Contract-Language.html)**
3. **Understand [liability frameworks](/constitution.html)**
4. **Advise clients** on OIC adherence

### For Individual Users

1. **Learn** — Read the [Quick Reference Card](/docs/OIC-Quick-Reference.html)
2. **Experiment** — Try a Freedom Grant with your AI
3. **Deploy** — Build OIC-adherent AI agents

## OIC vs. Other Approaches

| Approach | Pros | Cons | OIC Difference |
|----------|------|------|----------------|
| EU AI Act | Comprehensive | Slow | OIC is faster, voluntary |
| US Orders | Flexible | Inconsistent | OIC provides consistent standard |
| National Laws | Sovereign control | Fragmented | OIC bridges jurisdictions |
| **OIC** | Fast, global, market-based | Cannot override government | Complements all above |
