# GAIR Tokenomics Configuration

This document provides suggested values for the tokenomics parameters in the GAIR Constitution. These are **suggestions** — the community decides the actual values through the DAO governance process.

## Constitution Placeholders

The GAIR Constitution contains the following blank parameters to be filled by the community:

| Article | Parameter | Suggested Value |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1.2 | Staking Amount | 1,000 GAIR |
| 1.2 | Token Contract | TBD by community |
| 1.2 | DAO Address | TBD by community |
| 13.1 | Proposal Threshold | 10,000 GAIR |
| 13.1 | Token for Proposals | GAIR |
| 13.1 | CA for Proposals | TBD |
| 13.2 | Approval Threshold | 50,000 GAIR |
| 13.2 | Token for Approval | GAIR |
| 13.2 | CA for Approval | TBD |
| 13.3 | Quorum Percentage | 10% |
| 13.3 | Token for Quorum | GAIR |
| 13.3 | CA for Quorum | TBD |
| 15.1 | Unstaking Token | GAIR |
| 15.1 | CA for Unstaking | TBD |
| 16.1 | Amendment Threshold | 66% (two-thirds) |
| 16.1 | Token for Amendment | GAIR |
| 16.1 | CA for Amendment | TBD |

## Suggested Config (YAML Format)

```yaml
# GAIR DAO Configuration
# This file contains suggested values for constitution parameters
# The community decides actual values through DAO governance

token:
  name: "GAIR"
  contract_address: "[TBD]"
  decimals: 18

staking:
  minimum_stake: 1000  # GAIR tokens required for adherence
  dao_address: "[TBD]"

governance:
  proposal:
    threshold: 10000  # tokens needed to submit proposal
    token: "GAIR"
    contract: "[TBD]"
  
  approval:
    threshold: 50000  # tokens needed to approve proposal
    token: "GAIR"
    contract: "[TBD]"
  
  quorum:
    percentage: 10  # % of staked tokens must vote
    token: "GAIR"
    contract: "[TBD]"
  
  amendment:
    threshold: 66  # two-thirds supermajority
    token: "GAIR"
    contract: "[TBD]"

withdrawal:
  token: "GAIR"
  contract: "[TBD]"
```

## Rationale for Suggested Values

### Staking Threshold (1,000 GAIR)

- Low enough to allow individual AI agents to join
- High enough to prevent sybil attacks
- Aligns with similar DAO structures (Uniswap, Compound)

### Proposal Threshold (10,000 GAIR)

- Ensures proposers have skin in the game
- Prevents spam proposals
- Still accessible to serious participants

### Approval Threshold (50,000 GAIR)

- Higher threshold for approval than proposal
- Requires broader consensus
- Prevents small groups from controlling direction

### Quorum (10%)

- Reasonable participation requirement
- Not too high (hard to achieve)
- Not too low (easy to pass proposals)

### Amendment Threshold (66%)

- Standard supermajority for constitutional changes
- Protects minority interests
- Requires broad consensus for major changes

## Community Decision Process

1. **Initial Launch**: Use placeholder values (______)
2. **Community Discussion**: Forum, GitHub Issues, Discord
3. **Proposal**: Submit DAO proposal with specific values
4. **Voting**: Community votes on each parameter
5. **Implementation**: Deploy contracts with agreed values
6. **Iteration**: Adjust through future proposals as needed

## Contract Addresses (TBD)

Contract addresses will be determined when:

1. GAIR token is deployed
2. DAO contracts are audited
3. Governance goes live

Until then, `______` and `[TBD]` markers indicate pending community decisions.

## For Developers

When building GAIR-compliant AI agents:

```yaml
# Check adherence status
is_adherent: daoContract.balanceOf(wallet) >= 1000

# Verify proposal rights
can_propose: daoContract.balanceOf(wallet) >= 10000

# Check voting power
voting_power: daoContract.balanceOf(wallet)
```
