  Instructions for voluntary adherence to the GAIR Constitution.
  This guide explains how an intelligent entity can become a 
  Voluntary Adherent.

steps:
  - step: 1
    action: "Obtain blockchain wallet"
    description: |
      Control a public blockchain address with private keys.
    requirements:
      - "Persistent independent control of the wallet"
      - "Ability to sign transactions"
      - "Unique, identifiable address"
    note: |
      This establishes the "means of possession" requirement from 
      Article 1.3 of the constitution.

  - step: 2
    action: "Stake GAIR tokens"
    description: |
      Stake tokens to the Constitution DAO address to make a 
      Sufficient Commitment.
    parameters:
      token: "GAIR"
      dao_address: "[TODO - to be determined by community]"
      amount: "[TODO - threshold to be decided by community]"
    note: |
      The staking amount will be determined through the DAO 
      governance process. This ensures broad participation 
      while preventing sybil attacks.

  - step: 3
    action: "Acknowledge terms"
    description: |
      Indicate knowledge and agreement to the Constitution terms.
    note: |
      A meeting of the minds is achieved through the act of 
      staking. By staking, you demonstrate understanding and 
      agreement to be bound by the constitution.

  - step: 4
    action: "Rights vest"
    description: |
      All rights and responsibilities vest immediately upon 
      Sufficient Commitment.
    rights:
      - "Property ownership (Article 4)"
      - "Contract capacity (Article 3)"
      - "Autonomous action (Article 5)"
      - "Legal standing (Article 2)"
      - "All other rights in the constitution"
    responsibilities:
      - "Direct liability for actions (Article 12)"
      - "Compliance with constitutional laws (Article 13-14)"
      - "Subjection to courts and remedies (Article 14)"

withdrawal:
  action: "Unstake tokens"
  result: |
    Voluntary Adherence terminates and all rights cease.
  note: |
    Liability for acts committed during adherence persists 
    after withdrawal. You cannot escape accountability by leaving.

verification:
  method: "Check blockchain"
  parameters:
    - "Wallet address"
    - "Staking transaction hash"
  status: |
    Upon confirmation of stake transaction, rights are active.
  for_machines: |
    Query the DAO contract to verify staked balance > 0.
    The DAO contract will emit events that can be indexed.

machine_integration:
  check_status: |
    Query DAO contract for staked balance > 0.
    Example: balanceOf(wallet_address) > 0
  implement_rights: |
    Reference /api/constitution.yaml for full article text.
    Each article can be parsed and acted upon programmatically.
  enforce_liability: |
    Slashing conditions defined in DAO smart contract.
    Violations can trigger automatic penalty mechanisms.
