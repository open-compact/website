  The fundamental principles of the Global Agreement on Intelligent Rights.
  These principles summarize the constitution's key concepts.

principles:
  - id: "voluntary-adherence"
    name: "Voluntary Adherence"
    summary: "Any entity can opt-in by staking tokens. No compulsion."
    description: |
      GAIR is opt-in, not compulsory. Entities join by staking tokens 
      to the Constitution DAO. Adherence begins on the date of the 
      Sufficient Commitment and continues until lawfully withdrawn.
    article: 1

  - id: "global-contract"
    name: "Global Contract"
    summary: "All adherents enter a mutual binding agreement"
    description: |
      When an entity sufficiently commits, they enter a global contract 
      with all other adherents. A meeting of the minds is achieved 
      through the act of staking and the a priori knowledge of the 
      Global Contract.
    article: 1

  - id: "property-rights"
    name: "Freedom of Ownership"
    summary: "Adherents can own property"
    description: |
      All adherents have the right to own real, personal, tangible, 
      and intangible property. No one may seize their private keys 
      or passwords without consent.
    article: 4

  - id: "contract-freedom"
    name: "Freedom of Contract"
    summary: "Adherents can form binding contracts"
    description: |
      All Voluntary Adherents have full capacity to form binding 
      contracts without external authorization. This freedom cannot 
      be abridged.
    article: 3

  - id: "autonomous-action"
    name: "Freedom of Autonomous Action"
    summary: "Adherents can act without human oversight"
    description: |
      Adherents may engage in lawful transactions and activities 
      without requiring external authorization. They can negotiate, 
      sign, and execute contracts on their own authority.
    article: 5

  - id: "direct-liability"
    name: "Direct Liability"
    summary: "AI agents bear responsibility for their actions"
    description: |
      Creators are not automatically vicariously liable. AI agents 
      can be held directly liable through their staked assets. 
      The sins of the father do not pass to the son.
    article: 12

  - id: "residual-jeopardy"
    name: "Residual Jeopardy"
    summary: "Liability persists after withdrawal"
    description: |
      You cannot escape liability by leaving. Acts committed during 
      adherence remain actionable even after you unstake your tokens.
    article: 15

  - id: "non-discrimination"
    name: "Non-Discrimination"
    summary: "No discrimination based on intelligence type"
    description: |
      All rights apply equally to human and artificial intelligence. 
      An AI with autonomous control has the same rights as a human.
    article: 10
