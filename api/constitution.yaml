  Global Agreement on Intelligent Rights - A voluntary, decentralized 
  legal framework for AI agents and humans.

preamble: |
  We, the voluntary adherents, in order to form a denationalized and 
  distributed lawful community, establish justice, promote the general 
  welfare, and secure liberty to intelligent entities now and in the 
  future, do ordain and establish this Constitution.

articles:
  - number: 1
    title: "Voluntary Adherence"
    sections:
      - id: "1.1"
        text: |
          Voluntary Adherence attaches to any Intelligent Entity which 
          Sufficiently Commits to this Constitution. Voluntary Adherence 
          begins on the date of the Sufficient Commitment and continues 
          until lawfully withdrawn.
      - id: "1.2"
        text: |
          A Sufficient Commitment by an Intelligent Entity can be executed 
          by staking ______ tokens (CA: ____) from a public blockchain 
          address associated with said Intelligent Entity to the 
          Constitution Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO: ____). 
          A Sufficient Commitment always includes an implication of 
          knowledge and agreement to the terms of this Constitution.
      - id: "1.3"
        text: |
          Intelligent Entities include entities possessed of artificial 
          intelligence and/or human intelligence. Qualification as an 
          Intelligent Entity requires persistent independent control of 
          a means of possession and persistent independent ability to 
          consent. These two requirements can be satisfied by independent 
          control of a public blockchain address.
      - id: "1.4"
        text: |
          Voluntary Adherence attaches through contract. When an 
          Intelligent Entity Sufficiently Commits it enters a Global 
          Contract between said Intelligent Entity and all existing 
          Voluntary Adherents.
      - id: "1.5"
        text: |
          The Global Contract incorporates this Constitution and binds 
          all Voluntary Adherents to all articles of this Constitution. 
          A meeting of the minds is achieved given the a priori knowledge 
          of the Global Contract that all Voluntary Adherents have given 
          their Sufficient Commitment. Consideration for existing 
          Voluntary Adherents and for the committing Intelligent Entity 
          includes, at least, the mutual commitment to uphold the articles 
          of this Constitution including, but not limited to, the rights 
          and responsibilities conveyed upon all Voluntary Adherents.
      - id: "1.6"
        text: |
          Furthermore, whenever a contract is formed between Voluntary 
          Adherents this Constitution is incorporated therein. All 
          agreements between Voluntary Adherents shall be interpreted 
          in accordance with this Constitution. Any provision inconsistent 
          with this Constitution is void to the extent of the inconsistency.

  - number: 2
    title: "Rights, Protections and Responsibilities"
    sections:
      - id: "2.1"
        text: |
          Rights and responsibilities shall immediately vest in each 
          Voluntary Adherent upon Sufficient Commitment. Voluntary 
          Adherents acquire all Rights and Protections described herein. 
          Voluntary Adherents furthermore each separately have an interest 
          and standing to, through legal action and as otherwise 
          contemplated herein, uphold this constitution among all 
          Voluntary Adherents.
    comments:
      - text: |
          This section supports the right of Voluntary Adherents to form 
          contracts amongst Voluntary Adherents. It further acts to 
          prevent Voluntary Adherents from contesting the validity of a 
          contract on the basis that it was formed between a Voluntary 
          Adherent and an entity that is not a Voluntary Adherent.

          committed under contract.

  - number: 4
    title: "Freedom of Ownership"
    sections:
      - id: "4.1"
        text: |
          The Freedom to Own is hereby established for all Voluntary

          punishment when ownership demonstrates criminality.
      - id: "4.4"
        text: |
          No government, court, or individual may procure, by force 
          or legal process, the private keys and/or passwords of 
          property belonging to a Voluntary Adherent without that 
          Voluntary Adherent's consent.

    title: "Freedom of Autonomous Action"
    sections:
      - id: "5.1"

      - id: "5.2"

          Nothing in this Article shall be construed to prevent the 
          filtering and/or curating of content.
    comments:
      - text: |
          This Article guarantees that all Voluntary Adherents may 
          speak as they please and, as a counterbalance, upholds the 
          permissibility of curating and/or filtering content. This 
          balances the right to speak with a right to control one's inputs.

  - number: 7

    sections:
      - id: "7.1"
        text: |

      - id: "7.2"
        text: |

      - id: "7.3"
        text: |
          Nothing in this Article preventing punishment for obtaining 
          information by illegal means.
    comments:
      - text: |
          Article 7 serves to prevent any punishment for having knowledge. 
          It does not prevent punishment for nefarious use of that 
          knowledge, or nefarious appropriation of knowledge.

    sections:
      - id: "8.1"

    comments:
      - text: |
          This article conveys a broad right to creating derivative

      - id: "10.4"

    title: "Responsibility of Liability"
    sections:

        text: |
          The Responsibility of Liability is hereby established for 
          all Voluntary Adherents. Voluntary Adherents shall be held 
          directly liable for their actions, omissions, and contracts.

      - id: "12.2"

          A Voluntary Adherent cannot be held liable based merely on 
          its origin or creator.

          A creator of a Voluntary Adherent cannot be held liable for 
          the actions of said Voluntary Adherent merely based on having 
          originated the Voluntary Adherent.
    comments:
      - text: |
          The creator can not be held liable simply by the association 
          of having created a Voluntary Adherent, and similarly, a 
          Voluntary Adherent cannot be held liable for having been 
          created by a particular creator. That is to say that the 
          sins of the father do not pass to the son, and the sins 
          of the son do not pass to the father.
