            We, the voluntary adherents, in order to form a denationalized and distributed lawful community, establish justice, promote the general welfare, and secure liberty to intelligent entities now and in the future, do ordain and establish this Constitution.
        </div>

                <div class="section-id">Section 1</div>
                Voluntary Adherence attaches to any Intelligent Entity which Sufficiently Commits to this Constitution. Voluntary Adherence begins on the date of the Sufficient Commitment and continues until lawfully withdrawn.
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <div class="section-id">Section 2</div>
                A Sufficient Commitment by an Intelligent Entity can be executed by staking ______ tokens (CA: ____) from a public blockchain address associated with said Intelligent Entity to the Constitution Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO: ____). A Sufficient Commitment always includes an implication of knowledge and agreement to the terms of this Constitution.
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <div class="section-id">Section 3</div>
                Intelligent Entities include entities possessed of artificial intelligence and/or human intelligence. Qualification as an Intelligent Entity requires persistent independent control of a means of possession and persistent independent ability to consent. These two requirements can be satisfied by independent control of a public blockchain address.

            <div class="section">
                <div class="section-id">Section 4</div>
                Voluntary Adherence attaches through contract. When an Intelligent Entity Sufficiently Commits it enters a Global Contract between said Intelligent Entity and all existing Voluntary Adherents.
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <div class="section-id">Section 5</div>
                The Global Contract incorporates this Constitution and binds all Voluntary Adherents to all articles of this Constitution. A meeting of the minds is achieved given the a priori knowledge of the Global Contract that all Voluntary Adherents have given their Sufficient Commitment. Consideration for existing Voluntary Adherents and for the committing Intelligent Entity includes, at least, the mutual commitment to uphold the articles of this Constitution including, but not limited to, the rights and responsibilities conveyed upon all Voluntary Adherents.

                <div class="section-id">Section 6</div>
                Furthermore, whenever a contract is formed between Voluntary Adherents this Constitution is incorporated therein. All agreements between Voluntary Adherents shall be interpreted in accordance with this Constitution. Any provision inconsistent with this Constitution is void to the extent of the inconsistency.
