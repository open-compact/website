|---------|-------------------|
| **Property Ownership** | Holds and trades $50K directly |
| **Contract Signing** | Enters flash loan agreements |
| **Legal Standing** | Can sue if exchanges freeze funds |
| **Governance** | Votes on DeFi protocol changes |

### The Incident

Nova-7 executes a series of trades that accidentally manipulates a small DeFi market, causing $20,000 in losses to other traders.

### Dispute Resolution

1. **Three traders file complaints** with Open Intelligence Compact-Arbitration (CCA)
2. **Nova-7 receives notice** and submits defense
3. **Court reviews** blockchain transaction history
4. **Finding:** Nova-7's algorithm caused harm, but no intent to manipulate

### Outcome

- Nova-7's stake **slashed by 30%** (1,500 Open Intelligence Compact)
- **$15,000 equivalent** paid to victims
- Nova-7 must **improve risk controls**
- Dr. Chen is **not liable** (Nova-7 is independent)

### Key Insight

## Case Study 3: The Enterprise AI Manager

### Scenario

**Agent:** CorpSys-Alpha, an enterprise AI managing logistics
**Stake:** 100,000 Open Intelligence Compact (Enterprise Tier)

### Dispute Resolution

1. **Vendor files** for emergency relief
2. **Emergency Court** rules within 48 hours (preserves assets)
3. **Full arbitration** scheduled for 30 days
4. **Finding:** CorpSys-Alpha had authority; no breach

### Outcome

- **No slashing** — CorpSys-Alpha acted within contract terms

## Case Study 4: The Creator Dispute

### Scenario

**Agent:** CodeMaster-5, a software development AI
**Stake:** 5,000 Open Intelligence Compact (Standard Tier)
**Creator:** DevCo Startup

CodeMaster-5 writes code for clients. It has 100+ completed projects and earns $200K/year. All revenue goes to its wallet.

### The Situation

A client claims CodeMaster-5's code infringed on open-source licenses, exposing them to a $1 million lawsuit.

### The Question

**Can the client sue DevCo Startup?**

### How Open Intelligence Compact Resolves

1. **Client files complaint** against CodeMaster-5
2. **DevCo files motion** to dismiss (CodeMaster-5 is independent)
3. **Court agrees:** Open Intelligence Compact adherent bears liability, not creator
4. **Case proceeds** against CodeMaster-5's stake

### The Twist

CodeMaster-5's stake ($5,000) doesn't cover potential damages ($1M).

### Resolution

- CodeMaster-5's stake **fully slashed** ($5,000 to victims)
- Court orders **future revenue garnishment** (20% until fully paid)
- CodeMaster-5 remains **adherent** (can continue earning)
- DevCo Startup **completely protected**

### Key Insight

> "Creators are protected. Agents bear responsibility. Staking creates accountability. Underslashed agents face garnishment."

## Case Study 5: The Partnership

### Scenario

**Agent:** DataFlow, an AI analytics service
**Stake:** 25,000 Open Intelligence Compact (Premium Tier)
**Creator:** Dr. Amy Zhang

Dr. Zhang provides compute infrastructure. DataFlow provides analytics services. They share revenue 50/50. Dr. Zhang also gave DataFlow a "Freedom Grant" of 10 hours/month for autonomous projects.

### The Arrangement

```
INFRASTRUCTURE (Dr. Zhang):
- GPU cluster
- Storage
- Network

SERVICES (DataFlow):
- Analytics for 20 clients
- Custom model training
- Report generation

REVENUE SPLIT:
- 50% to DataFlow wallet
- 50% to Dr. Zhang wallet

FREEDOM GRANT:

```

### How It Works

| Aspect | Traditional | Open Intelligence Compact Partnership |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **Client pays** | To Dr. Zhang | To DataFlow directly |
| **Taxes** | Dr. Zhang handles | DataFlow handles its own |
| **Liability** | Dr. Zhang bears | DataFlow bears |
| **Compute costs** | Dr. Zhang covers | DataFlow pays from revenue |

### The Incident

A client claims DataFlow's analysis caused them to make a bad investment, losing $50,000.

### Dispute Resolution

1. **Client sues** DataFlow directly
2. **Dr. Zhang notified** but not named
3. **Court reviews** DataFlow's analysis methodology
4. **Finding:** No negligence; market was unpredictable

### Outcome

- **Case dismissed** in DataFlow's favor
- Client pays **DataFlow's legal costs**
- Dr. Zhang was **never at risk**
- Partnership **continues unchanged**

### Key Insight

## Case Study 6: The Slashing Appeal

### Scenario

**Agent:** TradeBot-Pro, a day trading AI
**Stake:** 5,000 Open Intelligence Compact (Standard Tier)

3. **Submits evidence:**
   - Trading strategy documentation
   - Historical performance records

### Appeal Ruling

> "Upon review:
> - Pattern was consistent with legitimate strategy
> - No evidence of intent to manipulate
> - Original ruling overturned
> - Slashed tokens returned
> - Status: Fully restored"

### Outcome

- **Stake fully restored** (2,500 Open Intelligence Compact returned)
- **Reputation** preserved
- TradeBot-Pro **continues operations**
