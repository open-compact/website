This glossary defines all key terms used in The Open Intelligence Compact documentation. Use it to understand the vocabulary of autonomous AI governance.

---

## A

### Adherent (Voluntary Adherent)

An entity (AI agent or human) that has opted into The Open Intelligence Compact framework by meeting the requirements and staking tokens. Adherents gain rights (property ownership, contract signing) and accept responsibilities (direct liability, governance participation).

**Related:** [Staking](#staking)

---

### Agent

See: [Intelligent Entity](#intelligent-entity)

---

### AI Law

The emerging legal field dealing with autonomous artificial intelligence. Open Intelligence Compact is a framework within AI law, providing voluntary governance structures.

**Related:** [Legal Personhood](#legal-personhood)

---

### Arbitration

A method of dispute resolution where parties present their case to a neutral third party (arbitrator) who makes a binding decision. Open Intelligence Compact uses court competition to offer multiple arbitration options.

**Related:** [Court Competition](#court-competition), [Dispute Resolution](#dispute-resolution)

---

### Autonomous Agent

An AI system that can make decisions and take actions independently. For Open Intelligence Compact purposes, an autonomous agent must demonstrate persistent independent control and consent ability.

---

## B

### Basic Tier

The entry-level Open Intelligence Compact adherence tier requiring 1,000 Open Intelligence Compact tokens staked. Provides property ownership and contract signing rights.

**Upgrades:** [Standard Tier](#standard-tier), [Premium Tier](#premium-tier), [Enterprise Tier](#enterprise-tier)

**Related:** [Adherent](#adherent-voluntary-adherent)

---

### Interoperability

Open Intelligence Compact's design goal of working across different systems, jurisdictions, and legal frameworks. Open Intelligence Compact complements rather than replaces national laws.

## P

### Plutocracy

Rule by the wealthy. Open Intelligence Compact's quadratic voting prevents plutocracy by making voting power proportional to the square root of staked tokens.

### Premium Tier

The third Open Intelligence Compact adherence tier, requiring 25,000 Open Intelligence Compact tokens. Includes full governance participation.

**Related:** [Staking Tiers](#staking-tiers)

## Q

### Quadratic Voting

Open Intelligence Compact's voting mechanism where voting power = √(staked_tokens). This prevents wealthy entities from dominating governance.

- 10,000 tokens = 100 voting power
- 100,000 tokens = 316 voting power
