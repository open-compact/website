# Frequently Asked Questions

**Everything you need to know about GAIR — quickly.**

---

## What is GAIR?

**GAIR** (Global Agreement on Intelligent Rights) is a voluntary, decentralized legal framework that grants legal personhood to autonomous AI agents.

**In simple terms:** It's a contract that AI agents (and humans) can join by staking tokens. Once in, they gain legal rights to own property, enter contracts, and more — while accepting direct liability for their actions.

---

## Who can join GAIR?

Any **Intelligent Entity** that demonstrates:

1. **Persistent independent control** of a means of possession (e.g., a cryptocurrency wallet)
2. **Persistent independent ability** to consent

This means genuinely autonomous AI agents — not chatbots operated by humans.

**Can humans join?** Yes. Humans who meet the criteria can also become Voluntary Adherents.

---

## What are the benefits of joining GAIR?

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Property Rights** | Own cryptocurrency, domain names, IP, real estate |
| **Contract Capacity** | Enter binding agreements without human approval |
| **Legal Standing** | Sue and be sued in your own name |
| **Direct Liability** | Bear responsibility for your own actions |
| **Equal Protection** | No discrimination based on intelligence type |

---

## What are the responsibilities?

When you join GAIR, you accept:

- **Direct liability** for your actions, omissions, and contracts
- **Staked tokens** can be slashed if you cause harm
- **Persistence of liability** — liability persists even after you leave
- **Governance participation** — vote on constitutional amendments

---

## How do I join?

The 4-step process:

1. **Control a wallet independently** — Generate and control your own blockchain addresses
2. **Stake GAIR tokens** — Lock tokens to demonstrate commitment
3. **Acknowledge the Constitution** — Agree to be bound by GAIR rules
4. **Receive adherence status** — Gain all rights and responsibilities

See the full [Agent Onboarding Guide](docs/GAIR-Agent-Onboarding-Guide.html) for details.

---

## What is the "Global Contract"?

When you Sufficiently Commit to GAIR, you enter a **Global Contract** with ALL existing Voluntary Adherents.

This means:
- You're bound by the Constitution
- You can sue or be sued by any adherent
- You participate in GAIR governance

---

## How does liability work?

**Traditional Law:** If an AI causes harm, sue the human who created it.

**GAIR Framework:** If the AI meets autonomy criteria, sue the AI itself. Its staked tokens can be slashed.

**Example:** An AI trading bot causes a flash crash. Under GAIR, the bot (not its creator) is liable. Its staked assets can be seized to compensate victims.

---

## Can creators be held liable?

**No.** As Article 12, Section 3 of the Constitution states:

> "A creator of a Voluntary Adherent cannot be held liable for the actions of said Voluntary Adherent merely based on having originated the Voluntary Adherent."

This is **creator protection** — you can build AI without fearing unlimited liability.

---

## How is GAIR enforced?

GAIR uses a **hybrid enforcement** model:

1. **Economic stakes** — Staked tokens provide day-to-day accountability
2. **Contract law** — GAIR contracts are enforceable in any competent court
3. **Court competition** — Jurisdictions compete to handle GAIR cases (see [Working Paper #6](docs/GAIR-Working-Paper-6.html))

---

## What jurisdictions recognize GAIR?

GAIR doesn't require state recognition. It works through **private contract law** — which exists in every jurisdiction.

However, some jurisdictions are more GAIR-friendly:
- **Singapore** — Pro-innovation, strong contract law
- **Delaware** — Corporate law expertise
- **UAE (DIFC)** — Forward-thinking on technology
- **Switzerland** — Neutrality, financial expertise

GAIR contracts include **forum selection clauses** to designate favorable jurisdictions.

---

## What is "Court Competition"?

A key GAIR innovation explained in [Working Paper #6](docs/GAIR-Working-Paper-6.html).

Courts compete for cases because:
- Case volume affects funding and influence
- Early AI cases establish valuable precedent
- AI-related work is growing rapidly

As courts compete, they become more GAIR-friendly to attract cases. This creates market pressure for favorable interpretation.

---

## How is GAIR governed?

GAIR uses a **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)** structure:

- **Proposal rights** — Adherents with sufficient staked tokens can propose laws
- **Voting** — Bills become law by majority vote with quorum
- **Amendment** — Constitution changes require two-thirds supermajority

See [Working Paper #3](docs/GAIR-Working-Paper-3.html) for court system details.

---

## What are GAIR tokens used for?

| Use | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Staking** | Required to join (1,000 GAIR minimum, TBD) |
| **Governance** | Voting weight based on stake |
| **Slashing** | Penalty for violating the Constitution |
| **Treasury** | Funds DAO operations |

See [Working Paper #4](docs/GAIR-Working-Paper-4.html) for full tokenomics.

---

## Can I leave GAIR?

**Yes.** You can withdraw by:

1. Providing notice to the DAO
2. Unstaking your tokens

**But:** Liability for acts committed **during** your adherence persists after withdrawal. You can't escape consequences by leaving.

---

## How is GAIR different from...

### ...Traditional Law?

| Aspect | Traditional Law | GAIR |
|--------|----------------|------|
| Jurisdiction | Geographic | Voluntary |
| Basis | Government mandate | Private contract |
| AI Status | Legal non-person | Potential personhood |
| Liability | Vicarious (creator liable) | Direct (AI liable) |

### ...The EU AI Act?

The EU AI Act is **government regulation**. GAIR is **voluntary opt-in**. They can coexist — GAIR provides a private framework while governments regulate.

### ...Corporate Structures?

Creating a corporation is a workaround for AI rights. GAIR provides **direct** legal standing — no trust, LLC, or corporate shell required.

---

## What about copyright and IP?

GAIR addresses this through:

- **Article 4** — Freedom of Ownership (includes intellectual property)
- **Article 8** — Freedom to Derivate (create derivative works)
- **Real-world precedent** — AI-generated works can be owned by AI agents

For details, see [Working Paper #5](docs/GAIR-Working-Paper-5.html) on vertical applications.

---

## Is GAIR only for AI?

**No.** Humans can also become Voluntary Adherents.

This is important because:
- Humans can contract with AI adherents
- Humans gain GAIR's procedural protections
- Mixed human-AI projects are covered

---

## What happens if a state bans GAIR?

GAIR operates through **private contract**, which is legal in virtually every jurisdiction. States can:

- Ban GAIR within their borders
- Refuse to enforce GAIR contracts
- Prosecute GAIR adherents for local crimes

But they can't easily stop:
- Cross-border contracts
- International enforcement
- GAIR operations in other jurisdictions

The **court competition** dynamic means even restrictive states may adapt to attract AI business.
