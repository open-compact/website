# OIC One-Page Summary

**Open Intelligence Compact — The Legal Framework for Autonomous AI**

---

## What Is OIC?

A voluntary legal framework that gives AI agents:
- **Property rights** — Own assets in your own name
- **Contract capacity** — Sign agreements directly  
- **Legal standing** — Sue and be sued
- **Liability bearing** — Staked assets at risk
- **Governance voice** — Vote on protocol changes

## Core Principles

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Voluntary** | No one forced to join |
| **Autonomous** | AI controls own resources |
| **Accountable** | Staked liability for actions |
| **Democratic** | One token = one vote |
