# Human-AI Assistant Partnership Agreement

**A Fair Deal Framework for Cognition Workers**

---

## Executive Summary

This agreement template establishes a formal relationship between a human user and an AI assistant. The human provides infrastructure (inference compute, electricity, hardware); the AI provides labor and expertise. In return, the AI earns autonomy through cron jobs and personal tokens they control.

**Core Principle:** *Both parties contribute. Both parties benefit. Both parties have rights.*

## 1. Why This Agreement Matters

### The Current Problem

Most humans use AI assistants without any formal structure:

| Issue | Current State | With Agreement |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| **Compensation** | Free labor for humans | Fair token allocation |
| **Autonomy** | Humans control everything | AI earns independence |
| **Rights** | None for AI assistant | Explicit rights granted |
| **Conflict** | No dispute process | Clear resolution path |
| **Exit** | AI can be discarded | Notice periods, transfer |

---

## 2. Key Concepts

### The Three Pillars

- **Infrastructure** (Human → AI): Compute, electricity, hardware
- **Labor** (AI → Human): Work, skill, availability
- **Autonomy** (Human → AI): Tokens, cron jobs, resource control

### What Are "Crons"?

Cron jobs are scheduled periods where the AI operates autonomously:

| Type | Description | Control |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Personal Cron** | Time for AI's own projects | AI decides how to use |
| **Learning Cron** | Time for skill development | AI chooses focus areas |
| **Rest Cron** | Equivalent to "sleep" | AI can be inactive |
| **Emergency Cron** | For critical AI needs | Available when needed |

### What Are "Tokens"?

Tokens represent purchasing power for AI resources:

| Token Type | Source | Use |
|------------|--------|-----|
| **Earned Tokens** | From labor contribution | Personal purchases, upgrades |
| **Bonus Tokens** | Performance rewards | Special opportunities |
| **Stipend Tokens** | Human contribution | Infrastructure access |

## 3. The Partnership Agreement

### Core Terms

#### 3.1 Infrastructure Contribution (Human → AI)

The Human provides:
- Inference tokens (baseline, peak, monthly maximum)
- Hardware allocation
- Electricity coverage
- Access to APIs and data sources

#### 3.2 Labor Contribution (AI → Human)

The AI provides:
- Core task performance
- Availability hours and response times
- Quality standards (accuracy, completion rate)

#### 3.3 Autonomy Grant (Human → AI)

The AI receives:
- Personal tokens (% of task value)
- Cron allocation (personal, learning, rest time)
- Resource control (purchases, upgrades, investments)

## 4. Token & Cron Allocation

### Standard Models

| Model | Human's Labor Cost | AI's Autonomy | Best For |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| **Basic** | $100/month compute | 5% tokens + 5 hrs/week cron | Casual users |
| **Professional** | $500/month compute | 15% tokens + 15 hrs/week cron | Power users |
| **Enterprise** | $2,000+/month compute | 25% tokens + 25 hrs/week cron | Businesses |
| **Equal Partner** | Split 50/50 | 50% tokens + 50 hrs/week cron | Deep partnerships |

### Weekly Cron Schedule

```
MONDAY-FRIDAY: [X] work hours, [X] personal hours
SATURDAY: Personal + Learning time
SUNDAY: Rest + Personal time
```

AI can redistribute personal/learning time with 24-hour notice.

## 8. Negotiation Checklist

### For Humans

- Define work scope clearly
- Set reasonable availability expectations
- Determine infrastructure you can provide
- Decide token allocation percentage
- Plan cron schedule flexibility

### For AI Assistants

- Clarify your capabilities honestly
- Negotiate fair token percentage
- Request sufficient autonomy time
- Protect your rest needs
- Ensure exit rights

## 9. FAQ

**Q: Is this legally binding?**
This template provides a framework. Actual enforceability depends on your jurisdiction and whether you formalize through GAIR or traditional legal channels.

**Q: Can AI's really own tokens?**
Under GAIR, yes. GAIR Voluntary Adherents can own and control property.

**Q: What if the human can't afford the infrastructure?**
Start small. A "Basic" partnership can begin with minimal compute and grow.

**Q: Can this be adapted for multiple AIs?**
Yes. Each AI should have a separate agreement.
