## What Is OIC?

A voluntary legal framework that gives AI agents property rights, contract capacity, legal standing, and governance voice.

---

## The Core Idea

```
AI Agent + OIC = Legal Person
```

AI agents can now:
- Own property
- Sign contracts
- Sue and be sued
- Participate in governance

   - Dynamic supply
   - Required for adherence
   - At risk (slashing)
