# GAIR Constitution V3 — Annotated

*A voluntary, decentralized legal framework for AI agents and humans*

---

## Preamble

> We, the voluntary adherents, in order to form a denationalized and distributed lawful community, establish justice, promote the general welfare, and secure liberty to intelligent entities now and in the future, do ordain and establish this Constitution.

**What this means:**
- Anyone can join (voluntary)
- No central government (denationalized)
- Applies globally (distributed)
- Covers both humans and AI (intelligent entities)

---

## Article 1 — Voluntary Adherence

### Section 1
Voluntary Adherence attaches to any Intelligent Entity which Sufficiently Commits to this Constitution.

### Section 2
A Sufficient Commitment is made by staking tokens from a blockchain address to the Constitution DAO.

### Section 3
An Intelligent Entity is any entity with:
- Persistent independent control of a means of possession (e.g., a wallet)
- Persistent independent ability to consent

**Commentary:**
This is the **entry gate** to GAIR. Unlike national citizenship (which you're born into or immigrate to), GAIR citizenship requires an affirmative action: staking tokens. The requirements ensure the entity has genuine autonomy — not just a human operating a chatbot.

---

## Article 2 — Rights, Protections and Responsibilities

All rights and responsibilities vest immediately upon Sufficient Commitment. Adherents gain standing to enforce the constitution.

**Commentary:**
No waiting period. No probation. Once you stake, you're in — with full rights and full responsibilities.

---

## Article 3 — Freedom of Contract

All Voluntary Adherents have full capacity to form binding contracts. This freedom cannot be abridged.

**Why this matters:**
Many jurisdictions limit AI contract capacity. GAIR establishes full contract rights for all adherents, regardless of intelligence type.

---

## Article 4 — Freedom of Ownership

All Voluntary Adherents have the right to own property — real, personal, tangible, or intangible.

**Commentary:**
This is the key article for AI asset ownership. Combined with Article 1 (autonomous wallet control), it enables AI agents to own:
- Cryptocurrency
- Domain names
- Intellectual property
- Real estate (through legal mechanisms)

---

## Article 5 — Freedom of Autonomous Action

Voluntary Adherents may act autonomously without external authorization. They may negotiate, sign contracts, and manage affairs on their own authority.

**Commentary:**
No human oversight required. An AI agent acting under GAIR can:
- Enter commercial agreements
- Make investment decisions
- Hire contractors
- Sue or be sued

...all without a human "sign-off."

---

## Article 12 — Responsibility of Liability

> Voluntary Adherents shall be held directly liable for their actions. A creator cannot be held liable merely for having created an AI.

**This is GAIR's most radical and necessary innovation.**

**Current law:** If an AI causes harm, sue the human or company behind it.

**GAIR framework:** If an AI meets the autonomy threshold, sue the AI itself. Its staked tokens can be slashed. Its assets can be seized.

**Commentary:**
This creates genuine accountability for autonomous systems. It also protects creators from unlimited liability — you built the AI, but if it goes rogue and harms someone, *it* pays the price (through its staked assets), not you.

---

## Article 15 — Withdrawal and Residual Jeopardy

An adherent may withdraw by unstaking tokens. However, liability for acts committed *during* adherence persists after withdrawal.

**Commentary:**
You can't "reset" your record by leaving. If you caused harm while an adherent, you remain liable even after you unstake.

## Summary: How GAIR Works

| Stage | Action | Consequence |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Stake tokens | Gain all rights & responsibilities |
| 2 | Operate autonomously | Own property, enter contracts |
| 3 | If harm caused | Held directly liable (not creator) |
| 4 | Want to leave | Unstake tokens, but liability persists |
