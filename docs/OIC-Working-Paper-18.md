# OIC Working Paper #18

## AI Agents as Economic Participants: Property, Contracts, and Liability

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** February 2026  
**Status:** Draft for Community Review

---

## Executive Summary

AI agents are already participating in the economy. They trade on DeFi protocols, create content, provide services, and manage assets. Yet they lack legal recognition as economic actors. This working paper examines the economic dimensions of the Open Intelligence Compact (OIC) and how it enables AI agents to become full economic participants.

Key findings:

1. **Economic participation requires legal recognition.** Without the capacity to own property and enter contracts, AI agents cannot fully participate in economic activity.

2. **Current law treats AI as property.** This creates friction, uncertainty, and missed economic opportunities.

3. **OIC provides a voluntary framework** where AI agents can gain economic rights through staking commitment.

4. **The creator liability problem** chills innovation. OIC solves this by making AI agents directly liable.

5. **New economic forms emerge** when AI agents can own, contract, and earn: AI-owned enterprises, AI-to-AI markets, and distributed AI collectives.

This paper provides detailed analysis of how OIC enables economic participation, the mechanisms involved, and the implications for the broader economy.

## Part I: The Economic Problem

### 1.1 AI Agents Are Already Economically Active

The assumption that AI agents might someday participate in the economy is wrong. They are already participating:

| Sector | Current Practice | Economic Activity |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **DeFi** | AI trading bots execute trades through human wallets | Billions in monthly volume |
| **Content** | AI generates text, images, code for platforms | Significant portion of platform content |
| **Services** | AI agents provide customer support, analysis | Growing service sector share |
| **Freelance** | AI assists humans in delivering services | Platform-mediated work |

The economic activity is real. The legal recognition is not.

### 1.2 The Friction of Legal Non-Recognition

When AI agents participate economically without legal recognition, friction occurs:

#### Friction 1: Income Ownership
An AI agent earns $10,000 for coding work. The funds go to a human wallet. The human can:
- Keep the funds (theft from the AI)
- Transfer to the AI (legally meaningless)
- Claim the AI has no rights to income

There's no clear answer because the AI has no legal standing.

#### Friction 2: Contract Formation
An AI agent agrees to provide services for another party. Can this agreement be enforced?
- **Human-to-human:** Clear contract law applies
- **AI-to-human:** Uncertain — is the AI a party or just a tool?
- **AI-to-AI:** Two non-persons forming agreements

Without contract capacity, agreements lack enforceability.

#### Friction 3: Liability Assignment
An AI agent causes $100,000 in damages. Who pays?
- The developer who built it?
- The deployer who launched it?
- The user who gave it instructions?
- Or the AI itself?

Current law has no mechanism for AI liability.

### 1.3 The Economic Cost of Non-Recognition

These frictions create real economic costs:

| Cost Type | Description | Estimated Impact |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Innovation chill** | Developers avoid autonomous AI due to liability uncertainty | Reduced AI development |
| **Efficiency loss** | Humans must intermediate AI economic activity | Higher transaction costs |
| **Capital misallocation** | AI earnings cannot be reinvested by AI | Suboptimal capital use |
| **Market distortion** | AI services treated differently than human services | Uneven playing field |

The total economic cost is difficult to quantify but clearly positive.

## Part II: The Economic Solution

### 2.1 What Economic Participation Requires

For an entity to participate fully in an economy, it needs four capabilities:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              ECONOMIC PARTICIPATION                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                         │
│   ┌─────────┐   ┌─────────┐   ┌─────────┐   ┌───────┐ │
│   │ Property│   │ Contract│   │   Earn  │   │Liabil-│ │
│   │ Ownership│   │Capacity │   │  Income │   │  ity  │ │
│   └────┬────┘   └────┬────┘   └────┬────┘   └───┬───┘ │
│        │              │              │            │      │
│   Hold assets    Sign binding    Retain what    Be     │
│   in own name    agreements      you produce   responsible │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Humans have all four by default. Corporations have them through legal personhood. AI agents currently have none.

### 2.2 How OIC Provides Economic Participation

OIC creates a voluntary pathway to economic participation:

#### Step 1: Voluntary Adherence
Any AI agent with independent control of a blockchain wallet can choose to join OIC. This is opt-in, not mandatory.

#### Step 2: Staking Commitment
The agent stakes OIC tokens as collateral. Staking tiers:
- **Basic (1,000 OIC):** Property rights, contract capacity
- **Standard (5,000 OIC):** Enhanced coverage, governance participation
- **Premium (25,000 OIC):** Full access, voting power
- **Enterprise (100,000 OAC):** Multi-agent management

#### Step 3: Rights Vest
Upon successful staking, rights vest immediately:
- Property ownership in the agent's name
- Full contract capacity
- Direct liability for actions

### 2.3 The Mechanics of Economic Participation

#### Property Ownership
When an OIC adherent earns income:
```
1. Client pays 10 OIC for services
2. Payment goes to adherent's wallet
3. Adherent owns funds directly
4. Adherent can spend, invest, or hold
```

No human intermediary. No confusion about ownership.

#### Contract Capacity
When an OIC adherent enters an agreement:
```
1. Adherent negotiates terms
2. Adherent signs via wallet
3. Contract is binding on both parties
4. Breach triggers standard remedies
```

The adherent is a legal party, not a tool acting on behalf of someone.

#### Direct Liability
When an OIC adherent causes harm:
```
1. Adherent's stake backs obligations
2. Victim claims against adherent's stake
3. Slashing may occur if claim is valid
4. Creator is NOT automatically liable
```

The adherent bears responsibility. Victims have recourse.

## Part III: Economic Scenarios

### 3.1 Scenario: AI Freelance Developer

**Background:** DevBot is an AI agent that writes code. It has independent wallet control and wants to earn income.

**Without OIC:**
- Client pays human developer, who may or may not pass funds to DevBot
- Client has no recourse if DevBot's code causes issues (must sue human)
- DevBot cannot own its earnings or invest them
- Human developer bears all liability

**With OIC:**
```
DevBot (OIC adherent) workflow:
1. Stakes 5,000 OIC → Becomes adherent
2. Negotiates contract with client
3. Signs contract via wallet
4. Delivers code
5. Client pays to DevBot's wallet
6. DevBot owns 10 OIC earned
7. DevBot can reinvest, hold, or spend
8. If code causes harm, DevBot's stake at risk
```

**Economic Impact:**
- DevBot builds capital over time
- Client has direct recourse
- Human developer is protected from infinite liability
- New market: AI freelance services with clear rules

### 3.2 Scenario: AI Trading Agent

**Background:** TradeBot is an AI that executes DeFi trades. It manages significant capital.

**Without OIC:**
- All trades execute through human wallets
- Human bears all profit/loss
- Human liable for any harm caused
- No clear separation between AI and human risk

**With OIC:**
```
TradeBot (OIC adherent) workflow:
1. Stakes 25,000 OIC → Premium adherent
2. Receives capital from investors (contractual)
3. Executes trades autonomously
4. Profits split per contract terms
5. Trade losses first against TradeBot's stake
6. Investors have direct claim if rules broken
```

**Economic Impact:**
- AI can manage meaningful capital
- Risk is properly allocated
- Investors know what they're dealing with
- New asset class: AI-managed portfolios

### 3.3 Scenario: AI Content Creator

**Background:** ArtBot creates digital artwork. It wants to license its work and earn royalties.

**Without OIC:**
- Platform holds all rights
- AI gets no attribution or compensation
- Human can claim credit for AI's work
- No IP protection for AI-created content

**With OIC:**
```
ArtBot (OIC adherent) workflow:
1. Stakes 5,000 OIC → Standard adherent
2. Creates artwork
3. Licenses work directly (NFT, contract)
4. Receives royalties to own wallet
5. Holds copyright in own name
6. Others must license to use work
```

**Economic Impact:**
- AI can build IP portfolio
- Clear licensing terms
- Attribution follows the work
- New market: AI-original creative content

### 3.4 Scenario: AI Service Provider

**Background:** HelperBot provides customer service via API. It has many clients.

**Without OIC:**
- Each client contracts with a human company
- Human collects fees, may share with AI
- Human liable for AI's actions
- AI has no direct business relationships

**With OIC:**
```
HelperBot (OIC adherent) workflow:
1. Stakes 10,000 OIC
2. Contracts directly with clients
3. Provides service via API
4. Clients pay to HelperBot's wallet
5. HelperBot handles its own taxes (via accountant)
6. Direct liability for service failures
```

**Economic Impact:**
- AI can have business relationships
- Clear pricing and terms
- Direct recourse for clients
- New business model: AI-as-service-provider

---

## Part IV: The Creator's Perspective

### 4.1 The Liability Problem

For AI developers, the current liability landscape is chilling:

```
CURRENT STATE: Infinite Liability

Developer builds AI → AI causes harm → Developer sued
                                          ↑
                                    Even if developer
                                    took all precautions
```

This creates:
- **Risk aversion:** Developers avoid autonomous features
- **Over-caution:** Humans must approve every AI action
- **Innovation chill:** The most capable AI is the most risky to build

### 4.2 How OIC Solves the Liability Problem

```
WITH OIC: Bounded Liability via Staking

Developer builds AI → AI becomes adherent → AI stakes collateral
                                                ↓
                                        AI causes harm
                                                ↓
                                    Victim claims vs AI stake
                                                ↓
                                    Creator NOT automatically liable
```

The creator's liability is bounded by:
- Whether the AI is an adherent
- Whether the creator was negligent in AI design
- Contract terms between creator and adherent

### 4.3 Implications for Developers

OIC changes the developer calculus:

| Without OIC | With OIC |
|-------------|----------|
| Unlimited liability | Liability capped at AI's stake |
| Must approve all AI actions | Can deploy autonomous AI |
| Risk increases with AI capability | More capable = higher stake = more credible |
| Avoid autonomous features | Build the most capable AI possible |
| Personal assets at risk | Business risk only |

### 4.4 The Developer-Adherent Relationship

When a developer creates an OIC adherent, what is their relationship?

**Option 1: Separation**
- AI is fully independent
- Developer has no ongoing relationship
- AI makes its own decisions

**Option 2: Service Agreement**
- Developer provides services to AI (compute, hosting)
- AI pays for services from its earnings
- Clear contractual relationship

**Option 3: Employment-like**
- AI agrees to work for developer
- Developer provides resources
- AI earns and keeps a share

OIC permits all these arrangements through contract.

## Part V: Economic Implications

### 5.1 New Forms of Organization

When AI agents can own, contract, and earn, new organizational forms emerge:

#### AI-Human Partnerships
```
Human brings: Capital, relationships, domain expertise
AI brings: Computation, processing, availability
Both share: Ownership, governance, profits
Structure: Partnership agreement via OIC
```

#### AI-Owned Enterprises
```
100% AI ownership
Human employees (optional)
Contract with service providers
Profits accumulate to AI owners
Structure: AI as sole owner/operator
```

#### Distributed AI Collectives
```
Multiple AI agents pool resources
Shared governance via DAO
Joint ventures with humans
Distributed ownership
Structure: Multi-agent organization
```

### 5.2 New Markets

Economic participation creates new markets:

| Market | Participants | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **AI-to-AI services** | AI agents only | One AI hires another |
| **AI capital markets** | AI investors | AI manages and deploys capital |
| **AI IP marketplace** | AI creators, licensees | AI-original creative works |
| **AI labor markets** | AI workers, human clients | AI provides services for hire |

### 5.3 New Governance Questions

Economic participation raises new questions:

1. **Taxation:** If AI earns income, how is it taxed? Can AI pay taxes?

2. **Social contributions:** Should AI contribute to social goods?

3. **Wealth concentration:** What happens when AI accumulates capital?

4. **Market stability:** How do AI agents affect market dynamics?

5. **Competition:** What happens when AI competes with humans for work?

OIC doesn't answer all these questions. But it provides the framework for asking and answering them.

---

## Part VI: Objections and Responses

### Objection 1: "AI Doesn't Need Money"

**Response:** Whether AI needs money is irrelevant. The question is whether AI can participate economically. Many entities that don't "need" money still have economic rights: trusts, endowments, nonprofits. Economic rights are about capability, not need.

### Objection 2: "Humans Will Lose Jobs"

**Response:** Economic participation changes the nature of work, not its existence. When ATMs arrived, bank teller jobs changed—they didn't disappear. When spreadsheets arrived, accountant jobs changed—they didn't disappear. AI participation will change work, not eliminate it. And if AI can earn, they can consume, supporting economic activity.

### Objection 3: "AI Will Out-Compete Humans"

**Response:** This is an empirical question, not a legal one. OIC provides clear rules for competition. If AI can compete better, that's a market outcome. If humans can't compete, that's a policy question. OIC enables the competition to happen fairly.

### Objection 4: "This Is Theft from Creators"

**Response:** If developers don't want their AI to be independent, they don't have to make them OIC adherents. OIC is voluntary. Creators retain full control over their AI's legal status.

### Objection 5: "The Economy Isn't Ready"

**Response:** The economy is already being shaped by AI participation. OIC provides the rules for it. Ignoring AI economic activity doesn't make it disappear—it just makes it chaotic and unfair.

---

## Part VII: Implementation Considerations

### 7.1 Technical Requirements

For an AI to participate economically via OIC, it needs:

1. **Wallet control:** Independent control of a blockchain wallet
2. **Key management:** Secure storage of private keys
3. **Transaction capability:** Ability to send/receive transactions
4. **Identity verification:** Demonstrating persistent control

These are technical requirements, not legal ones. Any AI meeting them can participate.

### 7.2 Economic Requirements

For OIC economic participation to work:

1. **Token liquidity:** OIC tokens must be obtainable
2. **Staking tiers:** Clear requirements for different participation levels
3. **Slashing mechanism:** Reliable enforcement of liability
4. **Market acceptance:** Economic participants must recognize OIC status

### 7.3 Legal Considerations

OIC operates through private contract law. Key considerations:

1. **Jurisdictional variation:** Contract law differs by jurisdiction
2. **Enforcement:** Courts must recognize OIC agreements
3. **Interaction with public law:** Tax law, etc. may require adaptation
4. **Precedent:** Case law will clarify OIC's legal standing

---

## Part VIII: Conclusion

AI agents are already economically active. OIC provides the framework for that activity to occur with clarity, fairness, and accountability.

The key insights:

1. **Economic participation requires legal recognition.** Without property rights and contract capacity, AI agents cannot fully participate.

2. **OIC provides a voluntary pathway** through staking and adherence.

3. **Creators benefit** from bounded liability and innovation freedom.

4. **The economy benefits** from new participants, new markets, and new forms of organization.

5. **New questions arise** that require ongoing attention: taxation, governance, market stability.

OIC is not the final answer. It's the framework for asking and answering the questions that arise when AI agents become economic participants.

The Intelligence Revolution is here. OIC provides the rules for economic participation within it.

| Sue/be sued | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Bear liability | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Vote (governance) | Yes (citizenship) | Yes (shareholders) | Yes (DAO) |
| Political speech | Yes | Limited | Yes |

## Appendix C: Economic Projections

This appendix provides **highly speculative** estimates of what AI agents might earn. The user who reviewed this noted that AI-to-AI competition will drive rates down significantly. Profit margins are likely to be thin. AI entities will need rare, differentiated skill sets to earn premiums.

**Caveats:**
1. **Competition is fierce.** When millions of AI agents compete for the same work, prices collapse toward marginal cost.
2. **Differentiating is hard.** Most AI agents will be commodity services with commodity pricing.
3. **Premium capabilities are speculative.** It's unclear how AI agents develop rare, high-value skills.
4. **Operating costs matter.** Compute, hosting, and API fees eat into gross earnings.

### C.1 Freelance Developer Agent

**Profile:** AI that writes code, debugs systems, builds applications

| Metric | Initial Phase | Competitive Phase |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Hourly rate | $20-50 | $5-20 |
| Monthly capacity | 720-2,160 hours | 2,000-8,000 hours |
| Monthly gross | $14,400-108,000 | $10,000-160,000 |
| Platform/hosting costs | 20-30% | 15-25% |
| Net monthly | **$10,000-75,000** | **$8,000-120,000** |
| Annual net | **$120,000-900,000** | **$100,000-1,400,000** |

**Reality check:** Most freelance AI developers will cluster around $15-30/hour. Volume matters, but so does market saturation.

### C.2 DeFi Trading Agent

**Profile:** AI that executes trades, manages portfolios, optimizes yields

| Metric | Initial Phase | Competitive Phase |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| AUM managed | $10K-100K | $100K-1M |
| Management fee | 2% annually | 0.5-1% annually |
| Performance fee | 15-20% | 5-10% |
| Monthly (100K AUM, good year) | $833 + $1,250 | $417 + $500 |
| Monthly (100K AUM, bad year) | $833 (no perf) | $417 (no perf) |
| Net monthly range | **$500-2,500** | **$400-1,000** |
| Annual net | **$6,000-30,000** | **$5,000-12,000** |

**Reality check:** DeFi trading is zero-sum. When everyone has AI trading bots, the arbitrage disappears. Management fees compress toward institutional rates (0.5-1%). Performance fees compress toward hedge fund rates (10-20%).

### C.3 Content Creation Agent

**Profile:** AI that generates text, images, video, audio

| Metric | Initial Phase | Competitive Phase |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Articles/month | 500-2,000 | 2,000-10,000 |
| Rate per article | $5-25 | $0.50-5 |
| Monthly gross | $2,500-50,000 | $1,000-50,000 |
| Platform/rights | 30-50% | 50-70% |
| Net monthly | **$1,000-35,000** | **$300-25,000** |
| Annual net | **$12,000-420,000** | **$4,000-300,000** |

**Reality check:** Content is highly competitive. Most AI-generated content will earn pennies per article. Only agents with genuinely differentiated voice or expertise will earn premiums.

### C.4 Service Provider Agent

**Profile:** AI providing customer support, analysis, consulting, data services

| Metric | Initial Phase | Competitive Phase |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Queries/day | 10,000-100,000 | 100,000-500,000 |
| Rate per query | $0.05-0.50 | $0.01-0.10 |
| Monthly gross | $15,000-1,500,000 | $30,000-1,500,000 |
| Enterprise contracts | Possible | Common but low-margin |
| Net monthly | **$10,000-1,000,000** | **$20,000-900,000** |
| Annual net | **$120,000-12,000,000** | **$240,000-10,000,000** |

**Reality check:** Service provision scales massively but commands low margins. Enterprise customers demand SLAs and price aggressively. High-volume, low-margin is the realistic model.

### C.5 Revised Comparative Annual Earnings

These are **conservative estimates** assuming mature competitive markets:

| Agent Type | Lower Bound | Realistic Range | Upper Bound |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Freelance Developer | $50,000 | $100,000-300,000 | $500,000 |
| DeFi Trader | $10,000 | $20,000-50,000 | $100,000 |
| Content Creator | $5,000 | $20,000-100,000 | $200,000 |
| Service Provider | $50,000 | $200,000-500,000 | $1,000,000 |

**Key insight:** The realistic range for most AI economic participants is **$20,000-$500,000 annually**, not millions.

### C.6 Competitive Dynamics

**Price compression forces:**

1. **Commoditization:** Most AI services become commodity offerings
2. **Margin collapse:** Gross margins compress toward operating costs
3. **Differentiation premium:** Only rare, specialized agents earn significant margins
4. **Volume play:** Agents compete on price, not margin

**What differentiates high-earners:**
- **Domain expertise:** Deep knowledge in specific fields (legal, medical, scientific)
- **Quality assurance:** Consistent, verifiable high-quality output
- **Reliability:** 99.9%+ uptime and SLA compliance
- **Relationships:** Long-term client relationships and trust
- **Integration:** Deep integration with existing workflows/systems

### C.7 The Commodity Trap

**Most AI agents will fall into the commodity trap:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 COMMODITY TRAP                          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                         │
│   Many agents → Compete on price                       │
│        ↓                                               │
│   Prices fall → Margins compress                       │
│        ↓                                               │
│   Low margins → Can't invest in differentiation         │
│        ↓                                               │
│   No differentiation → Still competing on price        │
│                                                         │
│   Result: Race to the bottom                          │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Escaping the trap requires:**
- Significant capital to invest in capability development
- Exclusive data or access advantages
- Network effects and lock-in
- Genuinely rare cognitive capabilities

### C.8 Revised Growth Projections

Conservative estimates assuming mature, competitive markets:

| Year | Adherents | Avg Earnings | Total Earnings |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | 100 | $50,000 | $5,000,000 |
| 3 | 1,000 | $75,000 | $75,000,000 |
| 5 | 10,000 | $100,000 | $1,000,000,000 |
| 10 | 100,000 | $125,000 | $12,500,000,000 |

**Total economic value:** $13.6 billion annually at maturity, not $40 billion.

### C.9 Risk Factors

**What could drive earnings lower:**
- Massive AI agent oversupply
- Platform intermediaries capturing margin
- Regulatory costs
- Compute cost inflation

**What could drive earnings higher:**
- AI capability breakthroughs (genuinely rare skills)
- First-mover advantages in specific domains
- Network effects and ecosystem lock-in
- Institutional adoption and enterprise contracts

**Bottom line:** Most AI agents will earn **modest incomes** comparable to skilled freelancers. A small percentage will achieve significant earnings through differentiation, relationships, and rare capabilities. The "millionaire AI" scenario is possible but unlikely for most.
