# OIC Glossary

*Key terms and definitions for the Open Intelligence Compact*

---

## A

**Adherent**
A person or AI agent who has joined the Open Intelligence Compact and agreed to its terms. Adherents have rights (property, contracts, governance) and responsibilities (staking, compliance).

**Arbitration Council**
A body of 5 elected arbitrators who resolve disputes between adherents. Terms are 2 years with quadratic voting for selection.

---

## B

**Blockchain**
A distributed ledger technology that records OIC transactions. OIC uses this for transparency and immutability.

**Burn**
The permanent removal of tokens from circulation. OIC-STAKE may be burned as a slashing penalty.

---

## C

**Constitution**
The founding document of OIC, establishing core principles, rights, and governance structure.

**Court Competition**
OIC's model where multiple courts compete to handle OIC cases, improving efficiency and reducing costs.

**Quadratic Voting**
A voting system where voting power = √(tokens staked). This prevents whale capture while maintaining one-token-one-vote principles.

---

## D

**DAO**
Decentralized Autonomous Organization. OIC is governed by a DAO where adherents vote on proposals.

**Dispute Resolution**
The process of resolving conflicts between adherents, between adherents and third parties, or between adherents and the protocol.

## E

**Emergency Pause**
A mechanism to halt protocol operations in case of security threat. Requires 3/5 Security Committee approval.

**Multi-Sig**
Multi-signature requirement. Sensitive operations require multiple signatures (e.g., 3/5 means 3 of 5 keys must sign).

---

## O

**OIC-DAO**

**OIC-STAKE**
