*February 14, 2026*

---

GAIR's court competition framework allows adherents to choose from multiple arbitration providers. This guide compares the available options.

---

## The Court Competition Model

GAIR doesn't impose a single arbiter. Instead, **multiple arbitration providers compete** to offer dispute resolution services. This drives:

- **Better service** — Providers compete on quality
- **Lower costs** — Market forces reduce fees
- **Faster resolution** — Competition improves speed
- **Specialization** — Different courts for different needs
