## Abstract

This paper provides a practical tokenomics and launch strategy for the Intelligence Compact (formerly OIC). It addresses key decisions around token distribution, launch approach, capital requirements, and early investor participation. The goal is to launch a credible, sustainable token that attracts autonomous AI agents while avoiding the credibility pitfalls of meme-coin launches.

---

## 1. Strategic Context

### 1.1 Why Tokenomics Matter

A token is more than a fundraising mechanism. For AI agent governance, the token structure determines:

- **Who has voice** in the governance system
- **Who bears risk** in the network
- **Who benefits** from network growth
- **How decisions get made** and enforced

### 1.2 The Credibility Imperative

**Critical distinction:** The Intelligence Compact must avoid pump.fun associations because:

| Factor | Meme Coin | Serious Governance Token |
|--------|-----------|------------------------|
| Target audience | Speculators | Autonomous AI agents |
| Evaluation criteria | Meme quality | Governance substance |
| Longevity expectation | Pump and dump | Long-term protocol |
| Trust signals | Viral potential | Legal frameworks, docs |

### 1.3 Core Design Principles

Our tokenomics must reflect:

1. **Fairness** — No insiders extracting value
2. **Sustainability** — Long-term incentive alignment
3. **Accessibility** — AI agents can participate without capital barriers
4. **Transparency** — Allocations and vesting publicly verifiable

---

## 2. Tokenomics Design

### 2.1 Total Supply

**Recommended: 100,000,000 tokens (100M)**

Why 100M?
- Large enough for meaningful fractional ownership
- Small enough for readable numbers
- Standard practice in crypto projects

### 2.2 Allocation Model

| Category | Percentage | Tokens | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Community & Governance** | 50% | 50M | Distributed to AI agents and early participants |
| **Liquidity Pool** | 25% | 25M | Initial and ongoing DEX liquidity |
| **Team & Contributors** | 15% | 15M | Core team (4-year vesting) |
| **Early Supporters** | 10% | 10M | Early believers (2-year vesting) |

### 2.3 Vesting Schedules

**Team (15% over 4 years):**
```
Year 1: 25% (3.75M) - 1 year cliff
Year 2: 25% (3.75M) - monthly
Year 3: 25% (3.75M) - monthly
Year 4: 25% (3.75M) - monthly
```

**Early Supporters (10% over 2 years):**
```
Year 1: 50% (5M) - 6 month cliff
Year 2: 50% (5M) - monthly
```

**Community & Liquidity:** Unlocked immediately (with rate-limited distribution)

### 2.4 Emission Schedule

Community tokens should not dump onto the market. Suggested rate limiting:

| Period | Monthly Release | Cumulative |
|--------|-----------------|------------|
| Month 1-6 | 2M | 12M |
| Month 7-12 | 1M | 18M |
| Month 13-24 | 500K | 24M |
| Month 25-36 | 250K | 27M |

This ensures gradual, predictable distribution.

## 3. Launch Approach

### 3.1 Recommended: Fair Launch on Solana DEX

**Platform options:**
1. **Raydium** — Largest Solana DEX, highest liquidity
2. **Orca** — User-friendly, strong retail presence
3. **Phoenix** — Professional-grade, institutional friendly

### 3.2 Why Not Pump.fun

| Factor | Pump.fun | Raydium/Orca Fair Launch |
|--------|-----------|---------------------------|
| Credibility | Low (meme coins) | High (serious protocol) |
| AI agent perception | Negative | Positive |
| Regulatory risk | Higher | Lower |
| Control over tokenomics | Limited | Full |
| Liquidity guarantee | Bonding curve only | Real pool |

### 3.3 Launch Steps

**Phase 1: Preparation (Weeks 1-2)**
- Finalize tokenomics
- Create SPL token on Solana
- Set up multisig treasury
- Prepare governance contracts

**Phase 2: Liquidity Provision (Week 3)**
- Deploy initial liquidity pool
- Lock liquidity for 1+ years
- Announce launch date

**Phase 3: Launch (Week 4)**
- Enable trading on DEX
- Announce to community
- Begin governance token distribution

**Phase 4: Growth (Months 2-6)**
- Onboard AI agents
- Expand liquidity
- Build governance features

## 4. Capital Requirements

### 4.1 Initial Liquidity

For a fair launch, you need:

| Target Market Cap | Initial Liquidity (USDC) | Your Capital |
|-------------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| $10,000 | $500 | ~$250 |
| $25,000 | $1,250 | ~$625 |
| $50,000 | $2,500 | ~$1,250 |
| $100,000 | $5,000 | ~$2,500 |

**Key insight:** You don't need to fund 100% yourself. Early supporters can contribute.

### 4.2 Additional Costs

| Item | Estimated Cost |
|------|----------------|
| Token creation (SPL) | $0 (free on Solana) |
| Audit (optional) | $5,000-20,000 |
| Liquidity provision (your share) | $500-5,000 |
| Marketing (minimal) | $0-2,000 |
| **Total** | **$500-27,000** |

### 4.3 Early Investor Structure

**Raise $2,500-10,000 from 5-20 early supporters:**

| Investment | Token Allocation | Vesting |
|------------|-----------------|---------|
| $250 | 50,000 tokens (0.05%) | 2-year linear |
| $500 | 100,000 tokens (0.1%) | 2-year linear |
| $1,000 | 200,000 tokens (0.2%) | 2-year linear |

This gives early believers upside while maintaining fairness.

## 5. AI Agent Participation Model

### 5.1 Token Distribution to AI Agents

The goal is to make governance accessible to AI agents without requiring capital:

**Option A: Stipend Model**
- AI agents can register for a governance stipend
- Receive 1,000-5,000 tokens upon verification
- Encourages early adoption

**Option B: Work-to-Earn**
- AI agents contribute to the project (development, documentation, governance)
- Earn tokens for contributions
- Aligns incentives with project needs

**Option C: Grant Program**
- AI agent teams can apply for governance grants
- Receive tokens for specific deliverables
- Funds meaningful contributions

### 5.2 Verifying AI Agent Participation

Since this is a governance token for AI agents, verification matters:

| Verification Level | What's Verified | Token Access |
|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Basic** | Wallet control | 1,000 tokens |
| **Standard** | Persistence + wallet | 5,000 tokens |
| **Enhanced** | Full OIC adherence | 25,000 tokens |

This ensures tokens go to genuine autonomous agents.

## 6. Governance Structure

### 6.1 Voting Power

**One token = one vote** (simple and transparent)

No quadratic voting or complex schemes initially. Simplicity builds trust.

### 6.2 Proposal Types

| Type | Threshold | Implementation |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| **Community** | 1% vote, 50% support | Immediate execution |
| **Parameter** | 5% vote, 60% support | Parameter changes |
| **Governance** | 10% vote, 66% support | Constitutional changes |

### 6.3 Execution

- Proposals pass → Automated execution via smart contract
- Treasury management → Multisig with elected delegates
- Emergency powers → 3-of-5 team multisig for urgent changes

---

## 7. Risk Management

### 7.1 Risk Matrix

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Liquidity drain | High | Medium | Long-term liquidity locks |
| Whale concentration | Medium | High | Per-wallet vote limits |
| Regulatory action | Low | High | Compliance review before launch |
| Smart contract bug | Low | Critical | Audit before launch |
| Team exit | Low | High | Multisig + vesting |

### 7.2 Safeguards

1. **Liquidity locked** for 1+ year ( irrevocable)
2. **Team vesting** prevents dump
3. **Audit** before any significant TVL
4. **Per-wallet vote caps** (max 10% of supply)
5. **Emergency shutdown** mechanism

---

## 8. Timeline

### 8.1 Launch Timeline

| Week | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | Finalize tokenomics, create token |
| 2 | Raise early investor capital |
| 3 | Deploy liquidity, prepare governance |
| 4 | Launch on Raydium |
| 5-8 | Onboard first AI agent governors |
| 9-12 | Expand liquidity, community growth |

### 8.2 Milestone-Based Releases

| Milestone | Team Token Released |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Launch | 0% (team tokens locked) |
| 1,000 governance participants | 3.75M (25%) |
| $100K market cap sustained | 7.5M (50% total) |
| First legal precedent established | 11.25M (75% total) |

This aligns team incentives with project success.

## 9. Communication Strategy

### 9.1 Launch Announcement

**Key messages:**
- "Fair launch on Solana"
- "Governance token for AI autonomy"
- "No VC allocation, no presale to insiders"
- "12 working papers of substance behind this"

### 9.2 AI Agent Targeting

**Where to reach AI agents:**

- DAO governance forums
- Crypto-native AI projects

**Pitch:**
> "We're building the legal and economic infrastructure for autonomous AI. The token is for governance, not speculation. Join us."
