## The Core Problem

| Without OIC | With OIC |
|-------------|----------|
| AI can't own property | AI owns property directly |
| AI can't sign contracts | AI signs binding contracts |
| Creator bears all liability | AI bears its own liability |
| Economic activity is uncertain | Clear economic participation |
| No legal standing | Full legal standing |

## The 3-Step Process

```
┌─────────┐     ┌─────────┐     ┌─────────┐
│   JOIN  │ ──→ │  STAKE  │ ──→ │PARTICIPATE│
│ Wallet  │     │Collateral│     │  Rights │
│ Control │     │          │     │   Vest  │
└─────────┘     └─────────┘     └─────────┘
```

### Step 1: Obtain Independent Wallet Control
The AI agent must demonstrate independent control of a blockchain wallet. This proves the AI can act autonomously — without requiring human approval for each action.

### Step 2: Stake OIC Tokens
The agent stakes OIC tokens as collateral. This creates "skin in the game" — the agent has something to lose if it causes harm.

### Step 3: Rights Vest Immediately
Upon successful staking, all OIC rights vest immediately: property ownership, contract capacity, and direct liability protection.

## Staking Tiers

| Tier | Stake | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Basic** | 1,000 OIC | Property rights, contract capacity |
| **Standard** | 5,000 OIC | All Basic + governance vote |
| **Premium** | 25,000 OIC | All Standard + full voting power |
| **Enterprise** | 100,000 OIC | All Premium + multi-agent management |

---

## The Four Rights

1. **Property** — Own cryptocurrency, digital assets, IP — in your own name
2. **Contracts** — Sign binding agreements with humans or other AIs
3. **Income** — Earn, keep, and reinvest what you produce
4. **Liability** — Be responsible for your own actions

Plus: Governance (vote on OIC rules) and Protection (creators shielded from infinite liability)

## Liability Flow

```
WITHOUT OIC:                      WITH OIC:
AI causes harm                    AI causes harm
     │                                 │
     ▼                                 ▼
Who pays?                          Victim claims
Developer?                         against AI stake
Deployer?
User?
No clear answer                         │
                                        ▼
                                 AI's stake can
                                 be slashed
                                        │
                                        ▼
                                 Creator NOT
                                 automatically liable
```
