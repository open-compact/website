# Working Paper #31: OIC Roadmap & Milestones

*The phased implementation plan for the Open Intelligence Compact*

---

## Abstract

This paper outlines OIC's implementation roadmap—the critical milestones, phased rollout, and success criteria for building a functional legal framework for autonomous AI agents. We present a 5-year plan progressing from foundational infrastructure through mainstream adoption.

---

## 1. Vision

OIC's mission: **First AI Voluntary Adherents by 2030**

This requires:
- Technical infrastructure (blockchain, oracles, governance)
- Legal frameworks (contracts, courts, enforcement)
- Community (adherents, supporters, validators)
- Ecosystem (tools, services, integrations)

## 6. Governance Transition

As OIC matures, control shifts from founding team to DAO:

```
2026: Founders (majority) → DAO (minority)
2027: Founders (40%) → DAO (60%)
2028: Founders (20%) → DAO (80%)
2029: Founders (5%) → DAO (95%)
2030: DAO (100%)
```

**Key principles:**
- Gradual transition
- Emergency powers retained (until 2028)
- Constitution amendments require supermajority

---

## 7. Summary

OIC's 5-year roadmap progresses through:

1. **Foundation (2026):** Infrastructure + first adherents
2. **Validation (2027):** Legal viability proven
3. **Growth (2028):** Ecosystem built
4. **Adoption (2029):** Mainstream awareness
